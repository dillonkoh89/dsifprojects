1254,"Gentle sleep training method for 10 month old? Hello,

My son is 10 months old. He slept pretty brilliantly early on (when most babies slept awfully). Then, at around 6 months (when a lot of babies sleep better), his sleep worsened.

We kept him in our room in a bassinet, until 6 or 7 months. Then, we moved him to his crib in his room because the bassinet didn't seem safe anymore. He was waking me up about 3x a night, which I thought was bad. I'm about to finish up the rest of my maternity leave (separated my leave into two leaves of absence) and I'm desperate. For the past three weeks or so, he's been sleeping in our bed and waking me up very frequently. We used to let him fall asleep in our bed because he wouldn't in his crib and, then, move him to his crib. He ended up just sleeping in our bed because he would suddenly wake up screaming each time we'd try to move him to his crib. He wakes up, pops up like a pop tart, rubs his eyes, looks for me, and throws himself on me. It's like he has to physically be touching me. Also, he still breastfeeds and I breastfeed him back to sleep a lot because he won't go back to sleep otherwise most of the time.

We tried the Ferber method a few months ago and it was traumatic. He gets very red and sweaty and just never stopped crying. Do any of you have any tips on more gentle sleep training methods?

I know him associating breast milk with sleep is a problem, him not falling asleep in his own crib is a problem, him napping with my husband on the couch while we've been on leave is a problem, etc., but I guess it's all easier said than done! We take covid quite seriously. So, he really only knows my husband and me. I feel this contributes to his separation anxiety.

Thanks!",1
2704,"My partner said he would ‘beg’ for me to have an abortion I (18f) was cuddling with my partner (20m) in bed, and we got on the topic of what we would do if the pill (which is what I’m on) failed and we got pregnant accidentally. 
For context we had this conversation before we started having sex and he had previously said my body my choice, he would respect what I wanted, as I had told him I don’t think I could ever have an abortion (I’m completely pro choice btw). 
Well, last night he then said ‘I’d ask you to abort, I’d beg you to’ and when I responded with the same as I’d said before, that I don’t think I could ever mentally cope with having an abortion, he kinda backed up on it. 
I feel like I’m overthinking this but it just shocked me because I know I can easily be pressured into things, and I know this is all hypothetical.",0
2451,"Confidence roller coaster So I'm a first year college student and in preparation for being up here I checked out the dating scene by changing my location. I met a guy named Bryan and we hit it off pretty well- we had both just graduated highschool, we had similar hobbies, and similar senses of humor. He's an average looking guy but that's the type of guy that in my eyes is most attractive. He's chubby and broad, tall, has strawberry blondish hair, a slight beard, some acne scars, and blue eyes. I would also like to think that I'm average looking as well- at this point its becoming a conflicting thought for me. I'm kinda chubby, medium height, medium length brown hair with bangs, like a broader build, and brown eyes. 

We talked for a month and when I moved up to college, we began dating. I basically moved in with him and I'm on good terms with his closest friends- particularly his friend shane. Shane is tall and skinny, he's got ""fluffy gamer boy"" hair,  and glasses with blue eyes. 
I mention shane because this is typically how Bryan meets girls. According to shane, most of Bryan's exes only dated Bryan to talk to shane. 
Which makes sense because when I looked at them they were all super pretty alt girls and everybody knows alt girls love a golden retriever gamer boyfriend. 

But in comparison to these exes I totally don't measure up lol I know my place on the scale of beauty and it is what it is. I have a fairly low self esteem and I have had that since I was a kid due to other issues; but when I look at my self standing next to Bryan in the mirror, I feel better about myself. I feel prettier and maybe that's just because I'm happy and everyone looks more alive when they're happy. 

In this way, being with Bryan has boosted my confidence. However sometimes Bryan says things that squashes it back down. 

For example: I was showing him my friends super pretty girlfriend because we had been talking about that friend. He had made some comment about how even if he had the choice between me or that girl he would pick me (firstly I inwardly rolled my eyes because damn, I know if I were him I would've picked her easily) but then he went on to elaborate why. He said it was because she was too pretty and that he didn't want to have to fight other guys for her attention. I nodded along because that made enough sense and I didn't mind the honesty there; although he continued on and said that he picked me because he knew he wouldn't have to worry about other guys wanting me. 

While I get it, it did hurt my feelings and my confidence went down a tad. 

The most recent example was last night though: he told me his coworkers wanted him to describe me cause they haven't met me, he told me that he told them this, ""well she's cute. She's not hot. I mean she's hot to me but not to like anyone else. Ya know, she's just cute."" 
They weren't pleased with that description so they pushed him further and he said, 
""I don't know how else to put it, okay so, I'll just said that I dated her because she's below my league and I know I won't have to worry about other guys."" Hr chuckled about it and his coworkers called him a dick for saying it. 

But why did he tell me that? It seems like an awful thing to tell someone you care about. 

And since he said it last night it's been all I can think about. Am I really that bad? Am I below his league?? Is he actually attracted to me or is he just settling so ""he won't have to worry about other guys""?

I don't think it's fair really for him to compare me to his exes because I don't honestly believe his league to be as high as them. Shane's league, sure; but I feel like it's given Bryan a massive ego boost despite the girls only using him. 

I honestly thought we about the same league, I even consulted a mutual friend and made them promise to tell the truth and they agreed. But damn, my brain is working it into a bigger and bigger issue. 

Does anyone have any input on the situation? Should I mention how it affects me to him? I feel like the thing he said last night won't be the last of the comparisons in which I'm dragged and no matter how many tiny confidence boosts I get from seeing a genuine smile matched with happy eyes, mentally I can't take a couple more drastic ego hits. 
I don't think he's doing it on purpose but maybe he is?

 Despite what he says about not having to worry about other guys he gets pretty possessive near them. 

When we went to a lake type of place our swimwear clad friend group walked past a group of decent looking guys, one of them said hello to me before our group quickly surged to the opposite direction. The two guys, shane and Bryan both, mumbled about how they would've beat the other guys up if they had tried something as we trekked further into the woods. When we got to where we were going we couldn't find a way to swim, so my friend Audrey and I left the guys there and said we were gonna find another way to swim. They both nodded and her and I took off. Once we had given up on finding it we turned back and ran into our boys almost immediately. Shane rolled his eyes but Bryan said that he didn't like me being without him after those guys ""looked at me like that""

I honestly just thought they were being friendly as we passed one another but our guys got different vibes apparently. 

Another example is when my friend rain had called me on snap and we were excitedly playing with dumb filters as we talked. Rain is a gay trans man who literally has a boyfriend but after about five minutes of us talking, Bryan got up, grabbed me, and gave me a really weirdly possessive kiss before sitting down. 

So what they hell is honestly going on here? Does he honestly think he doesn't have to worry about other guys wanting me or is he just saying that to make me feel like I don't have options aside from him? I'm no stranger to toxic relationships so I don't want to ignore the possibility of something more going on here. 

Could I be overthinking? Absolutely.
Could something be going on though? Maybe, and I don't wanna risk it.

If someone would be willing to read through this massive post and give me their thoughts I would honestly greatly appreciate it.",0
2369,"Why is getting over him so hard? Even though he is horrible to me Me and my ex were together for a year. We lived together and he ended it and moved out 3 months ago. Whilst we was together he ended it with me around 8 times. His moods are crazy and the slightest thing can make him turn. 
Since our breakup, he has blocked me, unblocked, told me he never wants to see me again, that he never wants to talk to me again etc. But then suggested being friends with benefits. 

Stupidly I said yes, and since then he has accused me of trying to trap him with a baby (despite being on the IUD) so he has been using condoms. The past couple of times we haven’t even had sex, he has just come over and stayed. Last time he said he was thinking of moving back in, then told me he was joking. And then after he said he wanted to get back together, then said he was joking again and just wanted to see what I would say. He has asked me to cook him stuff, give him massages and also asked me to make him breakfast before he left last time. 

I explained I want to be friends and build a friendship first, therefore do not want him back right now 

He keeps asking me how many people I’ve had over since he left, which is none because I’m still in love with him. Keeps asking if I’m talking to my ex, if I’m on dating profiles and that if I am it means I’m desperate. 
He was meant to be coming over this evening but just phoned me and said why did I ask him to and that I apparently said there needed to be boundaries. He asked if anybody new had been found to move into our flat as I am moving out soon, and I told him and he told me he doesn’t care and doesn’t want to talk about it anymore. I asked him why he was getting annoyed and he just said ‘please’. So I hung up. 

I’m so confused and I really do love him. I know it’s not right and it needs to stop but I’m so afraid of not having him in my life anymore",0
2098,"My (29F) husband (33M) is deleting messages from his female friend He’s using Instagram Vanish Mode, to be more specific. In case this isn’t already suspicious enough, this is the same female “friend” that I caught him deleting texts from nearly 8 years ago in the beginning of our relationship. I thought we’d moved past his sneaky behavior, but I’m ready to call it quits at this point. I cannot think of any reason besides cheating that someone would use this feature, or delete text messages from one person in particular on a regular basis. 

Im feeling like such a fucking idiot having spent this much time being played for a fool. This isn’t the first time or the only person with whom he’s partaken in shady behavior or social media. 

I see no point in having a conversation with him about it because I know he’ll just lie about it and get angry that I snooped. And for the record, snooping is not a regular thing for me; however, our relationship has been pretty rocky for a while and something just felt—off—kinda like when I found him partaking in the same activity with the SAME FUCKING PERSON 8 years ago.

797,"Stuck in preschool We are in a bit of a conundrum. My 4 year old is in a preschool. She loves going to a school. She has just gotten into drawing and loves it, though her drawings are typical of a 4 year old. I think they are great, but I’m biased. 

So the issue is that one of the teachers has a daughter in the same class and this kid has decided that she is going to target my kid. Makes fun of her. Takes toys from her. 

My kid had made some friends in the school but they are younger (2.5-3). But this kid is my kids age and basically all of the kids that age have banded together because they were there last year too. 

Tonight I learned that my kid was drawing a rainbow and this kid started to make fun of her. No teacher was around and I’m getting the impression that the teachers can’t control this kid because her mom is a teacher. She was so upset and was telling my wife about it. We are so happy that she’s getting into drawing so this stuff make me rage. 

I don’t know if we should pull her out of that school and find another?  Part of me feels that one needs to face this bullshit and learn from it. But at four years old???

Any advice?",1

2865,"Relationship with my [24M] girlfriend [24F] is unstable and I don't know what to do with my travel plans I've been with her for 5 years. 

She gained weight so I paid for her gym membership. Last year she was around 190 lbs. She went to gym around 6 months then covid happened, gyms got closed. So she again joined gym about a month ago and she was still 190 lbs, a month into gym she is still 190 lbs. She said her gym trainer is asking her to take personal training. I told her I can't afford that. I have already given for the membership, I can't pay more money which is like 6 times the gym membership. 

And I politely asked her, are you skipping gym or are you eating shit? Because there should be some change in you if you exercise and follow diet. 

She told me that she doesn't want me in her life and she will return the money I paid. I accepted her the way she was and she on the other hand is showing me this attitude. Post this, I blocked her.


Actual question:

Now coming to the actual question. We had plans for a vacation on her birthday so already took leaves from work. Now that the relationship is so unstable, im not sure whether we could go further on the vacation or not which is 2 months later. Now I'm concerned that if I cancel my leave plans what impression it would have on my employer because of my bitch ass girlfriend. What do you guys suggest? Fights like these are common now in our relationship.",0

2797,"Is it worth it? This is inappropriate but sonething about me attracts pedos and hebos. Either that, or most people are secretly pedos/hebos. 2 out of the last 3 guys I dated either said they would be willing to sleep with as low as a 13 year old, or that they would be willing to turn a blind eye to the SA of a young child in their care. Honestly one of the things that attracted me to my current bf more than anything else was that he was seemingly disgusted by the thought of having sex with a young teenager.

But he seems like the only one. One by one members of my friend group, many of whom I have known since WE were teenagers, are starting to gain attractions to highschool students. 

I can't take it. I can't listen to a 25 year old bitch about how their 16 year old crush isn't texting them enough. I Want to deck them I swear to God. I call them out on being predators, but 16 is the legal age of consent in my state (not Romeo and juliet laws. 16 just is the age. So if a 50 year old is dating/sleeping with a 16 year old its perfectly legal here.)

At this point it seems that almost all of my friends have crossed this line. I'm starting to feel numb. I'm so disappointed. Is having friends worth it? Part of me is thinking about just closing myself off. Either there is something deeply wrong with me making me attract these people into my life, or most humans are litterally predatory monsters in hiding. Because no matter how much time and effort and energy I put into fostering a friendship, they always end up hebo trash. 

Is having close friendships even worth it?",1
1323,"Family ""Friendly"" Youtubers and controversial opinions Hello parents. Having a bit of an internal debate so I figured I'd put this out to a wider space. We subscribe to a YouTube channel called The Adventure Agents. My son has been a huge fan of their many channels and it's a great channel about survival, bushcraft, basically all sorts of playing in nature with kids. They even have mystery solving arcs that the lead dad (Agent Tex) solves with his children and family/friends. We even subscribe to their paid app and I hope to soon get some merch if I can work out this internal debate. 

Now let me preface this by saying, I am not trying to start any sort of debate about COVID/ nature , or any subject I bring up here. I am not trying to get the parents of the channel doxxed, hated on, or cancelled.  I realize we all come from different walks of life. I'm a city girl born and raised with not too much outdoor experience.

I was on their Instagram, as I am here and there to keep an ear for merch news and the like. In their story seemed to be a response from a fellow subscriber asking that Agent Tex keep his opinions about viruses off the kids show. I haven't had a chance to see the video in question but he mentions viruses being harmless apparently and she had to calm her traumatized child as they had suffered loss. 

His stories and posts just seem to have an air over the last months of ""a religion of fear"" and  ""do you but we're going to do us"". I have no problem with that in the main but the thinly veiled vaccine hesitancy and sometimes cult-ish language makes me uncomfortable.

There's more but I will leave it here. My question basically boils down to, would this sort of thing give you pause? Or make you avoid the content? Or I am being too sensitive? I know it can be said ""If you don't like it, scroll"" or ""They're entitled to their opinions."" But I'm hoping to hear from other parents who are fans and maybe see this trend too? I was just wondering if this was a case of reading too much into it or time to pull back. Thank you.",1
1153,"Explaining 9/11 to my 9 year old whose birthday is 9/11. I’m sure I am over thinking this but I’d appreciate other perspectives. My daughter’s birthday is September 11th. She will be 9 this year. 

I want to explain what happened on 9/11 before she learns from someone else. She is a very sensitive child. For example, watching Hidden Figures led to months of conversations about how it isn’t right that people are not treated equally. She has a huge heart, and it’s in the right place. Because of this I know hearing about the attacks will upset her, even more so because it is associated with her birthday. 

Has anyone dealt with this? I’ve looked at a few books and a short documentary aimed at children. I don’t want to open the conversation before knowing exactly what to say.

379,"Depression and parenthood Let me preface that I have struggled with depression for most of my life. When I was pregnant, I struggled when I realized how abnormal my childhood was. (My dad was very abusive). 

 After I had my son, it got much worse due to PPD and I got help. Then covid derailed most things and after six months of not having help, I've been consistently seeing a therapist since January.

Even typing this post out makes me feel breathless. Today, I had no energy. I was laying on the couch when my 2 year old came to give me a kiss. Then he came over with his snack and tried to feed me. Then his water bottle. Eventually he snuggled up with me on the couch. 

I feel so guilty. I see perky moms who are dancing with their kids, going for runs and bike rides, but it was almost overwhelming to make a meal today. I hate myself for not being better. I hate that he has a mom like me. I'm tired. I'm so, so tired and feel desperately alone.",1

2153,"Spouse's parent is ill and it is affecting our family life Having a difficult time in my marriage and personal life. My spouse of 20 years, ""Casey"" has a parent with escalating health issues. Their health has been deteriorating for several years, and over last 18-24 months they have been in and out of hospital. Casey is primary caregiver, and it is tough. This has taken up more and more of their free time. It is very much like another full/part time job on top of their regular full time job. Casey is at the hospital or nursing home 2-3 nights per week, and is on the phone for 1-2 hrs on other nights. I very much sympathize with them and do what I can to support them and be a good partner and parent to our kids. I take care of the kids when Casey isn't home, support my spouse emotionally as best I can, and do the housework.

Unfortunately this situation really is taking a toll on our family life. When Casey is home, they are disengaged, on their phone pretty much all the time. I do understand, because it's stressful to be a caregiver, but we really rarely have meaningful conversations anymore, b/c when Casey is home they are either scrolling on their phone, or talking to their parent or doctors - it takes up a lot of mental bandwidth. Plus they go to bed early, so there really is only a 1-2 hour window nightly, if that. There isn't a whole lot of parenting going on, and it's been really hard to have the tough conversations about how to parent our kids. So it's been taking a toll on them, both in terms of lack of time spent and lack of parenting. Again this has been going on for 18-24 months, but really for the last several years. 

I've also been having a hard time personally. I'm depressed a lot, for a variety of reasons, but TBH I feel guilty unloading my problems on Casey, plus they are usually busy dealing with their parent, or on their phone, so they are simply not available. Lately I've been trying to be more sympathetic about my own mental health - everyone could use support in life. But because of this situation I do not have a supporting partner right now, and life is lonely and not enjoyable. And that in turn is affecting the kids even more, which I feel even worse about - it's a downward spiral. I know this sounds selfish, it is.

Anyway, I'm sure others have gone through this when their spouse's parent is ill. If this is you, do you have any advice? How do you manage your self-care and family life in this situation? How should I approach Casey about this?",1

1855,"My Bf (21) thinks I'm (F20) over correcting after my abusive ex and not prioritizing him enough. Hey! So I know this is probably a not the most interesting post but I really need some outside perspective. 

Some context: Me and my bf have known each other for 3 years, dated casually for 1 year and been officially together for two months. But since we've been close for so long it feels like we've been together a lot longer. We live in different cities (about 1h30 away from each other) so meeting up requieres us to plan ahead. We're both in uni and I have a half time job so we can only really see each other on weekends. My bf  has a some insecurities from a past relationship, the girl cheated on him and lied for years, so he needs a lot of reassurance. I was in a very toxic relationship before we met, the guy I was seeing was very controlling/ insecure and I ended up isolated from most of my friends and family members. That situation is long over and with therapy and time I've managed to re establish a good relationship with my family and to reconnect/make friends- My bf knows all of this, he was there for most of it. 

The problem is that now that we're together I'm trying to not neglect other aspects of my life. We still see each other once a week, he stays over and we spend a day or sometimes two together. But I usually have other plans before and after seeing him, I invite him to some but I also want to spend time with just my friends. We often have to organize time to see each other around my other plans and responsibilities. Also, my sister is moving to another country  so my priority these last few weeks has been spending time with her. I haven't had time to go visit him, I don't have a car for the moment so he has been coming to see me (I do feel bad about this, I'm working on fixing it so I can see him more often). I talked to him about my car situation and my sister leaving a month ago, he told me he understood. 

Now he tells me he's not happy with our relationship, he feels like I'm not prioritizing him enough. He says I treat him more like another friend than boyfriend. I hate making him feel this way, I've already made plans to come and visit him for an entire week when my sister leaves. But part of me feels like he's being unreasonable, I see him every week, talk to him everyday, I just need to have a life outside of my relationship. I also thought he would be more understanding about me needing to prioritize my sister. He feels like I may be overcorrecting from my last relationship and neglecting him instead, I think he's exaggerating a bit and should try to be more understanding.  How do I make him feel more valued without sacrificing the new life I struggled so much to build? 

tldr: Bf thinks I don't prioritize him enough, I need to have a life outside of the relationship. How do I make him feel more valued without sacrificing the new life I struggled so much to build?",0
2608,"Stuck on a Girl Hey guys, I’ll try and enjoy as coherent about my predicament but feel free to ask questions!

I’ve been stuck on this girl for a little over a year, I can’t get her out of my head, and I keep engaging in self destructive behavior like checking her socials/constantly thinking when she will comeback.

I connected with this girl I met on tinder, and we talked for 6 months during the pandemic (couldn’t meet due to COVID restrictions), then during the fall of 2020 she moved to a different country for grad school. She ended up closing off the conversation last September, and when I tried reaching out in June she said she was in a completely different place than where she was last year and was looking to get into anything. We both struggle with depression, so I’ve been trying to be mindful of that as well. She blocked/unadded me on pretty much everything, which hurt immensely after I followed one of her alt accounts on Instagram in June.

We had such a strong connection but it fizzled out. I’m not sure if the block was a boundary thing to try and get us both to get better (never pushed her to do anything, I treated her with respect and kindness, and she reciprocated). I really think she’s the one, so I’m having a really hard time and can’t let go.

I’m also having a hard time thinking that the block was telling me to fuck off and take the hint but I’m not sure. She didn’t really communicate much to me other than telling me she was in a different place and wasn’t interest in starting up again. All I’m sure of is that we had a really strong connection and flowed easily. We talked so smoothly and had so much in common it was strange we hadn’t met before.

We used to play switch games together, as well as sending each other playlists and collaborated on some together. She even had one playlist titled LDR with some of the songs we both shared/listened to in it. I don’t want to break the boundary she put up but I feel so stuck I’m not sure what to do. I have always been very supportive and genuine with her, so I don’t want to become intrusive. I just want to love someone and she was the perfect woman for me. I feel like she has the same feelings for me, she doesn’t seem like the type of girl to do this because she’s trying to get rid of me, more that she’s trying to get her own mental health right.

 Am I delusional? I’m going to try and stop feeling really shitty about it but I was wondering if I could get some perspective on this :/ thanks y’all!",0

So, my child is 4 now. Her father and I had been good friends for awhile, then I moved to England for a guy, he ended up being abusive. I moved back home in America and stumbled upon my old friend in a game. Within 6/7 months he had moved across the country to be with me, and about 6 months later I found out I was pregnant.  

He was never a very good father (or partner if I'm being blunt).  He was caught cheating with girls he met online multiple times. Never physically with them, but sending photos, telling these girls he loved them and making plans to meet, pretending I wasn't around and he was a single dad.  The last one hurt the most. I did almost everything for our daughter. I woke up/stayed up with her, I changed most the diapers, I made sure she was fed and clean, I took her to all her appointments, 99% of the time by myself. We had a roommate for the first 3 years, and he would often complain that while I was at work and my kid's dad was home, dad would be sleeping most of the time and my roommate would do most of the care. Nothing I said about how he needed to change stuck for more than a week. About a year ago the apartment lease was up and her father and I decided to break up but, because of covid and finances, find a new apartment together to coparent. 

It was frustrating to say the least. He mostly hid in his room playing video games. I had already felt like a single parent and this just magnified it. I was an opening/early shift server at a breakfast place. I often got off work around 1/2pm and would always call to see if I needed to grab anything and many times it would be lunch for the kid because she's probably hungry, aka he hadn't made sure she had lunch. She's always been picky/not hungry during breakfast, so by lunch she's normally fairly hungry. And like many kids (and adults) she gets rather hangry. He would just get frustrated that she was acting out and throwing tantrums. I'd come home to her ""in timeout"", which was just him shutting her in her room with a tablet while he did whatever. 

It escalated when I came home to the kitchen and my room trashed. He was shut in his room with her, until I got home and she came out immediately, and I near kicked down his door asking if he was going to help clean up. Turned out she had woken up, knocked down the gate to the kitchen, taken out knives, the pizza cutter, all sorts of dangerous stuff. Put some in my toilet, soaked a whole roll of toilet paper and left the sopping lump on my bed. I was livid and tore him a new one. I thought this had to have scared him, he had to have learned a lesson. I was wrong.

Couple months of no incidents go by when he calls me at work. He had slept all day. My daughter, freshly 4 at this point, left the house. I had left for work around 7am, and as always opened his door and told him I was leaving. Daughter at that time typically slept until 8. The police report has a statement that someone saw her at 11am wandering around outside. Around 1pm the police found her in the parking lot. They only found out where she lives because she had taken my dog with her and he is chipped. (She is struggling with speech though its getting better now). He was still asleep when they came to the apartment,  looked around for her too when they asked if he knew where she was. She was taken to my parents (already a rough relationship). He was charged with neglect and I kicked him out. He moved back across the country.

So now for the last about 4 months I have truly been a single parent. Its been chaos! She has had anger issues at daycare, hitting other kids and throwing tantrums. We were victims in a hit and run when I had to go pick her up early, which led to fighting insurance for 2 months (finally fixed, car is totalled but at least everything is covered and paid for).  He has barely been in contact. She came home 2 days before he moved and he barely spent time with her and got mad because I couldn't take him to the airport (she had a stomach bug, thanks daycare, and was vomiting the whole time she was home before he left).  He came back for court and I graciously picked him up when his car rental fell through, he still managed to only spend maybe 2 hours with her and that was only because he was packing up more of his stuff at the apartment. He's called maybe once every 2 weeks, but because her speech is still behind and she's not the best at keeping her attention on the phone, the calls have been short. 

Through all this, her speech and behavior have gotten better. Somehow my credit has gotten better. Life overall has been better. It hasn't been easy at all. I have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember, and while it tries to rear its ugly head she motivates me to stay strong. She's a wild, impulsive little girl, but also so sweet and loving. She'll drive me up the wall with her stubbornness and anger at being told no, than come over and unprompted give me a hug and apologize for getting so angry after her timeout (real ones with talking and then sitting quietly to calm down, not the crap ones her dad used to give her).

I just needed to vent I guess. We're working on no naps and the evening before bath and bed time can be rough. I was struggling a bit. I want a quiet night to myself. I want a day without a tantrum. I want a whole day where she doesn't bring me the jar of pickles 6 times over asking for one when she doesn't even like pickles (why child? Why?).  I mean, I love her. So much. And even saying all those I wants I know I don't actually because the 3 weeks she was at my parent's then sister's house were maybe the worst 3 weeks of my life.  I literally don't understand how her dad is just living his life across the country from her without breaking more each day. 

Thanks for reading all that if you did. I'm just a single mom trying her best to make up for the damage her dad did (and me for letting him be in her life so long). I just kept thinking this is his child, he'll get it together. I never ever would've thought he'd endanger her, and once she got in the kitchen I was sure that would've ""scared him straight"". I'll probably feel guilty for the rest of my life.  I also know I'll always love my little monster and do everything I can to give her the best life possible.",1
1095,"11 year old is stubborn and unmotivated… My 11 year old daughter has always been a sweetheart, and she still is! She is not disrespectful, she’s very caring towards others (adores hugs), great older sister, does well in school — I could literally talk about her forever.

But it has been a real struggle and even more so as of late with her stubbornness and lack of motivation.

Her stubbornness is the kind where she will try to prove her wrong way right (I hope that makes sense). For example, when she was learning math in school (she will be going to middle school in a few weeks) she would put two different equations together to try to figure an answer out   Sometimes they would be right (by happenstance) and sometimes they would be very wrong. When trying to explain that she has to follow the equation just as the teacher instructed, she would reply with saying it was easier for her to do it that way.

That is one out of many examples I’ve heard that made my parent brain melt. And they aren’t all with school. Sometimes it’s following directions to bake a cake with me, or if I’m teaching her how to play a game…but as long as the way she’s doing it is easy for her, wrong way or not, she just wants to do whatever doesn’t require more attention. I just don’t get it. And the end result is of me just saying, ”Well… you have to do it the right way,” because i don’t know what else to say and I try my best for my confusion to not come off frustrated. I used to think she only did this to me and my husband, but she has consistently done this with teachers, her friends, grandparents…

And as for the lack of motivation…i read that stubbornness is just that: a lack of motivation. I can completely believe that. The thing is: nothing motivates this child. She’s not attached to her toys, her computer, the games on her computer, the promise of a cell phone (we even tried giving her an old phone for her to test the waters and she lost it 🙃 lol), her art supplies, tv — NOTHING. She never asks to hang out with friends (I’ve been the one doing that for her for years now and even with me telling her for years she can ask to go places or have friends over. I just assumed she was still too young to think that far).

I just don’t know what to do, and any advice at all would be great. Thanks for listening!",1
1997,"Girl [23F] I [27M] liked for so long told me she loves me weeks ago, then tells me she wants to date other people I had a crush on her for years now, ever since the first time I saw her in one of the hallways of our university. And I liked her a whole lot more after we started talking during the lockdowns here in the Philippines. She was in a long term relationship (a little over 3 years) that turned toxic at the time, so I didn't make a move and just settled on being her friend. Her boyfriend was cold and often insensitive. She desperately tried to make it work at the cost of her feeling less and less of herself over the course of their relationship. She needed a friend, not someone who'd steal her away from him, so that's what I resigned myself to.

Almost a month ago, I told her how I felt. She was leaving the city where our university was in to go back home. I thought it couldn't hurt to tell her since she was leaving even though she was still with her boyfriend. I thought all that would happen is she'd be flattered and over time we'd grow more and more distant. I didn't think that she would break up with her boyfriend, then weeks later tell me she loves me.

I wasn't so naive that I believed her right away. It sounded too good to be true. So while I got to talking to her more and more, while I was getting close to her, I had my guard up. It was just recently when I started to believe it. Not long after that she tells me she needs to see other people.

She told me that a friend of her's wanted to set her up on a date with his friend. She tells me how good it felt that, after for so long, it was something she could say yes to. She told me that she felt that it was something the part of her that loves herself needed, the part of herself that grew smaller and smaller over the years she spent stuck in that toxic relationship.

I was hurt, maybe it was naive for me to think that her telling me she loved me that this wouldn't happen. Probably what hurt more was I was gullible enough to let myself believe it. 

I asked my friends for advice, and they all said the same thing and probably what a lot of you would say too; I should just walk away. But for some reason I'm still at a loss on what to do, on whether not I should just leave or if I should take a gamble and see if she still wants me after she's done seeing other people.

TLDR: Girl who said she loves me wants to see other people and I don't know what to do",0

2309,"I might have to cut my stepbrother out of my life. TL;DR : 15 years ago my dad made sexual advances toward a 14 year old girl. We just found out, and I decided to go NC with my dad forever. Step brother is saying it might not be true and my mom might be manipulating me. I don't know if I would be justified in cutting him out of my life too. It would hurt everyone because we are very close knit step siblings.

---

15 years ago, when my parents were still married, my oldest brother (14 at the time, now 29M) had a friend (""Mary,"" 14F) who had a really bad home life. My mom offered to have her stay with us so that she wouldn't have to go into foster care. Mary stayed with us for a little while, then chose to go to foster care and didn't tell us why. She basically cut contact with us since then.

Fast forward 15 years, to a couple months ago, Mary reaches out to my mom. She explains to my mom that back then, my dad (43 at the time) was making advances towards her. Telling her how beautiful and sexy she was, how good her legs looked next to the campfire light, that kind of thing.

Recently I (24F) started EMDR therapy for my PTSD. I'm currently working through some memories that involve my dad, and decided that at least for a little while, I had to go no contact with him while I worked through these things. Then when Mary reached out to my mom, my mom told me and my two biological brothers (26 &amp; 29) and their wives. She said that she felt we had a right to know. 

Biological brothers have been fully NC with dad for 10 years, I was the only one trying to maintain a relationship. I was only trying to do that because my dad remarried, and I really love my stepmom. And I also have two step brothers (30 &amp; 33) and one of them has two kids (7M &amp; 3F) and I love all of them too.

After finding this out, I decided that my temporary no contact would be permanent, forever. Even if he's changed, I would never be able to trust him around any child I might have, and any future partner I have. My biological brother explained a while ago that they had a responsibility to protect their wives and their kids from anything they could, and that included protecting them from my dad -- this only further confirmed their stance. 

I told my step brothers about Mary because I knew that when they found out I was never speaking to my dad again, they would ask why. One of them said he understood why I was making that choice. The older one, the one with young children, said that my dad has changed a lot and that my mom might have said all this in an attempt to manipulate me.

I was worried that I was going to lose the relationships I built with my step brothers, and my niece and nephew. But my mom has bent over backwards trying not to demonize my dad and not influence our decisions and whether or not to have a relationship with him. My bio brothers and I all came to these conclusions on our own. And the suggestion that she might say anything to manipulate me away from my dad is just preposterous. She's not a perfect woman but, when my parents were married, there *was* a manipulative lying narcissist in that marriage and it wasn't her.

I understand that my stepbrother might not want to believe it's true, but I think it's pretty telling that there was a 14 year old girl who *chose* foster care because she didn't feel safe in my father's presence. I don't know if it's worth maintaining a relationship with my stepbrother if he's going to accuse my mom of manipulating me.",0
1670,"Me (18F) and two guys that I'm conflicted on I am an 18-year-old who has feelings for two different guys. It hasn't always started off like this. I never intended to put myself into this position. I guess I will start from the beginning. I met the first guy from work, let's call him Christian. We fooled around for a while and I brought up the question, ""what are we?"" As much as I hated asking that question, I started catching feelings for him. We'd often get food together during our breaks, I ended up taking him home from work and would even drive him to work as well. We'd call almost every night and text each other every day. The first month we started talking, he told me he didn't want anything serious. Fast forward to today, we have been talking for about 9 months. We've shared a lot of great memories together and got closer to each other than I expected. He makes me feel so safe, calm, and comfortable. He makes me feel beautiful (corny I know), and cared + loved for. But whenever my friends ask him why we aren't together yet, he always brushes it off. Although, he recently joined the military, and have not seen him for 3 months. Since he joined the military, he isn't able to use his phone every day. But we ended up writing a few letters to each other and he always tells me how much he misses me. He comes back in December. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the 2nd guy, let's call him Jose. I met him through a friend after Christian left for basic training. It's been 3 months of talking to him and we've been hitting it off very well. (He's also in the military, I don't know why I attract military guys), After the first week of hanging out with him, he popped the question, ""what are we?"" It actually caught me by surprise when he asked me that. Since I have feelings for another guy, I told him I didn't want anything serious. We call almost every day and call each other almost every night. I even met his friends and they all like me than the other girls he has talked to. It has been very easy to talk to him, but every time we get intimate, I always think about Christian. I think about how much I miss him and how much I can't wait to see him. But Jose and I had a conversation about if this was going to be something serious. Jose has made me feel comfortable and protected. When we had this conversation, he told me he could see a relationship between us and that he won't push for it if I don't feel the same way towards him. 

I know I don't have to make a big decision right now and that I'm not in a rush to make one. But I know, I will have to make a decision eventually. My dilemma is the decision I want to make. Christian knows how I feel and always gives me mixed signals. He gets jealous when I talk about another guy, but never admits that he is jealous. Although, Jose is not afraid to show me off. 

Sidenote: I had a conversation with my cousin and he told me that it was possible that Jose is a substitute for Christian. And it really got me thinking a lot. 

I just don't want to make the wrong decision and regret it. If I wait for Christian to come back, what if he still doesn't want anything serious with me? Because I'm at a point where I don't want to waste my time and energy on anyone. What if I cut off Jose and miss out on something that could be great? What do you guys think?",0
2511,"I (27F) lost my v-card in a terribly awkward way. How can i move on? *this is a pretty long post, so thank you in advance for taking your time to read!
** not sure if this is the right subreddit to post; I also marked it as NSFW in case some infornation is too...detailed.


I'm the soul of the party. I hype everyone up, i sing, i dance silly and sometimes sexy. I love having fun. People sometimes think i'm an easy girl, but the truth is, i was a virgin until last week and no one knew. I'm not religious or anything, i just couldn't feel any connection or relate to anyone i talked to.
And now, after the below situation, i feel that i'm not even made for this whole love/sex thing.


Last week, i lost it to a guy that i used to be in love with a few years ago. My feelings are no longer strong, so i just treated my night with him as just...plain sex and fun without getting too attached.


First things first, i know that he is not prepared for something serious, and neither am i. Secondly, our lifestyles are very different. I've always felt this attraction/chemistry between us, but i don't believe we would match as a couple anyway.
So last week, we just went out dancing and one thing led to another, with me ending up in his bed.


He didn't know that i was a virgin until i started bleeding. I was hoping that i'm one of those cases where you don't bleed, but no. He went pretty hard i think, and i wasn't wet enough (there was no proper foreplay, just a few minutes of us making out). 
The act itself hurt so much and i couldn't wait for it to end. I kept asking myself: ""is this the reason why people cheat and is this the inspiration behind beautiful art? Why, it feels so bad!"". I moaned, wrapped my legs around his back and moved my hips because i didn't want to be a starfish, but it still felt bad.


Anyway. TLDR, I bled and stained his multiple layers of sheets. I still feel embarrassed, even now. FML. I still feel like crying when i think of it.
I wasn't expecting that we'd have sex that night, so when things got heated up, i was afraid that i'll ruin the mood if i tell him...
I know, this is my mistake. I should have told him. 


The fact that i bled gave it away and once he finished (he said he did, but now i'm not even sure, since he was wearing a condom), we talked about the whole thing. He kept asking me if i was ok and told me that i should have told him, cause he would have been gentle. I told him that it's ok and that he shouldn't feel pressured now that he was my first and that we should just live in the moment. I actually wanted to let him know that i'm not going to be clingy, since a lot of people get attached to their first sexual partners.


I apologized tens of times for staining everything, i told him that i'll go buy some bleach in the morning, but he kept telling me to shush, because it's ok and he'll take care of it. 


I took the sheets off the bed, went to the bathroom and then went back to bed, we talked a bit more and went to sleep. No hugging, no cuddling. I caught him staring at me a few times, and he kept asking me if i'm ok and if i regret it. I said that i don't regret anything. We eventually agreed to keep it between us and not tell anyone about it (since we've got some mutual friends). Shortly after, we fell asleep.


When we woke up, i felt extremely pained, overwhelmed, awkward, and embarrassed. I knew i was supposed to leave soon because he had to go on a trip. So i called a cab and left. When i stepped out of his apartment, i told him: ""so, this stays between us, ok?"", and i awkwardly high fived him without even looking at him. I don't know why i did that, ugh. Again, i felt so overwhelmed, confused, embarrassed and...well, unreal.
While i was leaving, he told me to take care and i said ""you too"", without being able to look behind me.


That was all. We did not talk afterwards. Yesterday, he showed up in my following suggestions on ig, and so i followed him, but he didn't follow me back. Clown face emoji.


I guess the only thing to do is forget about this all and move on. But it's hard.


I don't want to text him, cause i don't want him to think that i'll start being clingy or anything like that. But at the same time, i don't want him to stay mad or disappointed in me. Or whatever feelings he's having right now. 
I didn't catch feelings for him, but all i want is to keep being in touch, just like before, and i'm not sure if he still wants that. And i'm too ashamed to contact him. 
What would he say, anyway? A polite ""it's ok, don't worry"", which would probably be even more awkward than no response at all? 


What can i do about my uncontrollable feelings, though? I keep having random flashbacks and i get embarrassed. What if he didn't like what he saw, what if he was disappointed, what if he just thinks i used him to get rid of my v-card, what if he is mad that i stained his sheets and a bit of his mattress? These questions keep popping and i can't do anything without randomly remembering about the moment and getting embarrassed. I feel so awkward and stupid. 


What would you do in my position? I mean, i don't think it's relevant to contact him now, but how can i stop thinking about this embarrassing moment? How can i move on?",0
1529,"The scariest moment of my life is when the school lost my 5yr daughter today I just need another place to vent this.


Some background. She started kindergarten this year, and she has special needs because of a speech disorder. She can't communicate to those she isnt comfortable with or doesn't know. This is important to what happened. She also has a sezuire disorder. 

This is their 3rd day, second full day. 

I'm not sure what anyone else's grade school is set up, but when they leave for the day, kids who walk home go to one exit (in the back of the school), and kids who are picked up go to another. I always pick up my daughter. Parents are not allowed in the building due to covid. 



This is where it went wrong. First, being the third day of school the teacher forgot she was a pickup and put her in the wrong line, the line to go to the back entrance to walk home.  Then while she was back there, I was told that she seemed to walk off with an adult or other kids, so no one checked to see if she had an adult with her. After she walked away all the teachers went back inside.
Who the hell  let's a 5 yr old just walk away from school without questioning it? 


In the meantime, I'm in line to pick her up. They tell me they think she is in the back. I waited there 10 to 15 mins before the principal tells me all the kids in the back are gone, and what they think happened. So they started searching the school grounds.

They have no freaking clue where she is!
They lost her! 
I'm pissed and scared. 

I didn't want to wait for them. If she walked away, who in Gods name knew where she could be. 


I drove around to the street  to get to the back of the school, and she is right there, walking down the street 3 blocks from the school scared and lost!
I got out and hugged her so much. We called the school and I ripped into the principal. 

The poor girl thought I didn't come for her so they just sent her on her way!! 

We made it back home, but that could have gone so much worse!!

Toddler decided to get on my float with me, so we were playing in the water, and I see that her new animal float is gone! I’m looking around for it (it’s a busy lake with several people in the water) and I see some parents pushing their toddler on it! 

I’m so non confrontational, I wasn’t even going to say anything. But we were about to leave and my friend said, “no we’re getting her float.” So I swam over and politely explained that we were leaving and they had our float. They were very apologetic, but I still don’t understand why you’d take someone else’s float! I’m very anal about my child not touching anything that doesn’t belong to her.

2728,"Crushing guilt of wanting divorce Hi everyone,

My husband (51m) and I (46f) have been married for 22 years, together 28 years. We have two teenagers. About 5 years ago or so, my husband began to lose interest in sex. Frequency moved to maybe once a month or less. Over the course of the last 3 years, we've had sex maybe 2 to 3 times per year. In 2020, we had sex one single time. Over the years, I've expressed concern, I've told him how important intimacy is to me, I've threatened to leave, I've suggested he see doctors or a therapist. He has taken no action.

This year has been hell for me. In the last 18 months, we've tried to be intimate 3 times, unsuccessfully. The difference now is my body doesn't respond either, so it's both of us not being engaged. Earlier this year, I suggested marriage counseling. Sitting in the very first appointment, I realized I was done. I had lost all romantic feelings for him. During the years of his inaction and our lack of any physical intimacy, something died inside me. I realized I needed to say things I couldn't say in front of him. I asked for us to seek individual counseling instead of couples. He agreed and it dawned on him that I had one foot out the door. When he realized this, he started clinging and love bombing me. Asking me on dates, taking me places he never would have gone before. Giving me zero space to think. I resented this even more. Intimacy isn't our only issue, but I was able to overlook other problems when physical intimacy was there. It took a bit of time to get in with a therapist, so I've only had two sessions. Unfortunately, by that time, my heart was no longer up to trying to salvage our marriage. 

I know I want a divorce for me. But I still love him. I no longer feel romantic love, but I care for him and want him to be OK. He's a good person and a good father. This feels so selfish and I feel so guilty. I know what I want, but I'm so afraid of how badly this will hurt my family.

How do you get over the crushing guilt of wanting out when there is no 'catastrophic' reason? When your spouse hasn't done some horrible, unforgiveable thing?

Thank you.",0

However, there's a thing he does sometimes which I'm not so sure about: he gets into a state like he's posessed, laughs with no reason, jumps on couches/beds (he's not allowed to), hits, talks back...but the issue is that we can't get to him  to pull him out of it.

He usually does this when he's a bit tired (usually doesn't want to take an afternoon nap)  and something he doesn't particularly likes is about to happen (e.g. bed time, medicine, etc). He eventually stops if he doesn't get reactions, he hurts himself and starts crying or if we physically hold him down until he stops (he'll usually lie first and say ""ok, I'm not doing it anymore"", but if you let him go he's back to jumping and laughing).

What the fark is this? What worries us is that we can't get him to stop or listen to us by talking.

1130,Sleep issues for 20 month old? Can anyone tell me why my kiddo (who previously would prefer I (mom) put her to sleep every night) now won’t go to sleep for me but goes down right away for her dad but is having early wake time of 5:30 every morning?

1086,Unimmunized daycare workers More of a rant than anything else.  We live in the PNW and our 18 month old has to go to daycare because both of us work.  They recently closed down for two weeks because multiple staff members tested positive for COVID.  Today was the first day back open and while they were going over their new protocols to try to minimize more outbreaks it came out that multiple staff members are unvaccinated.  This completely blew my mind.  How can you be taking care of young children who can't be vaccinated and refuse through pure selfishness to not protect them.  Thankfully our state just put in a mandate that all childcare workers have to get the shot but they have another month to do so.  Thankfully they have already had three staff who refused leave their jobs.  Good riddance to them.,1
856,"Inviting versus reprimanding I'm going to describe a situation that repeats itself regularly in my household. My intention is not to denigrate my husband nor invite any recriminations on his behalf.  Not looking for solutions- we've got this. It's more of a ""hey, maybe some of you can relate"" post, plus just writing this out might help me. 

Background context: My kid is four and deeply in love with me (mama). I treasure this time, but also- I'm an introvert. Obviously, the pandemic has made getting time and space alone difficult. In addition, my husband has stopped pursuing and planning outings and visits with others. I am not only the preferred parent, but also the sole (Covid-cautious: masks &amp; outdoors) planner. I make the visual calendar, I set the routines. I'm also a SAHM, which is not my first choice but, you know, the pandemic. So my husband is the earner, which means he has less energy for  than I do. But I'm also the over-extended introvert, which means I sometimes run out of energy, too. We have a ""parent-on-duty"" schedule, but...

Reality: I cannot get space unless my husband actively engages with our kid or takes her out of the house. He's quickly exhausted by her and pulls out his phone a lot. I'm more of the fun, emotionally available parent (my husband is also fun, but in shorter spurts. stupid phone addiction.)

The hardest part about this situation is the transition from my care to his care. He reprimands our kid for interrupting me, not going to do something else, gets frustrated when I allow her to interrupt, and tells her what she can't do.

What I really want, what works best for me, is if he instead invites her to go do something else. This is a general guideline I use with people of all ages. If you want someone to stop doing something, invite them to do something else. Like, ""yeah, Mama hugs are great! hey, do you want to go dig for worms or walk to the bakery?"" Telling the kid she is doing something wrong (and I just don't see seeking a hug from mom as wrong, pretty much ever) just escalates the insecurity that fueled her behavior in the first place. If you've read this far, you probably think I'm a pushover with no boundaries. This is absolutely not true. I'm also the parent that sets and holds the boundaries- I just do it with a lot of empathy and patience that my husband doesn't always have (and I don't always have either, let's be real. Sometimes I let things slide because that's life.) I'm working on communication with my husband around this and we're doing out best in the middle of a move and a pandemic with no childcare or family support.

Thanks for reading the rambling.

TL;DR

Reprimanding small children for seeking out their safe adult does not help any situation. Inviting small kids to do something is a great way to redirect behavior. The pandemic is hard on extroverts, introverts, and everyone in-between...but maybe especially parents.",1

2594,"Should I break up with my military boyfriend? I (21) have been in love with my military boyfriend (21) for 4 years now (since 2017) and had an on-and-off long distance relationship for the past 3 years (since 2018). These past 8 months though have been the healthiest we’ve ever been, where we didn’t need to take a break or break up. 

My boyfriend was raised in a household that wasn’t quite affectionate, and that’s why I think he isn’t romantic. Combine that with his military lifestyle, which is long work shifts and unpredictability, and I get someone who isn’t as romantic enough and isn’t fully engaged in our relationship as I want him to be. 

My first question is: is this concept normal for military long distance relationships? 

The past 3 years where we were on-and-off I have been loyal to him and only him. I have never been involved with someone else. He is my only relationship. But in 2020, we didn’t talk the whole year (broken up). I did try dating other guys for the first time, and it was nice to experience what their treatment was like. The guys I dated didn’t work out because I didn’t think I was compatible with them ultimately. 

Anyway, my main concern and reason behind this post is that I feel like my boyfriend isn’t addressing my needs. He doesn’t really talk to me, and when he does, he isn’t as engaged the way I see him interact with other people. He doesn’t have a lot to say, and honestly the relationship is boring to me. I’m wondering if I’m being a bad girlfriend by not being understanding enough or are my needs really not being met enough that it requires a break up. 

Mind you, the reason why we were on-and-off for the past 3 years is because I kept being upset about a past mistake of his (not cheating, just disrespected me for a period of time), and he believed breaking up with me would make him stop hurting me (because he loves me).",0
2476,"Can anyone advise me on how I can cope with this? My (22M) girlfriend (19F) and I just broke up. I could talk for days and days about why it happened. I do feel I did the best I could. I also feel she did the best she could, too, but with her trauma and anxiety from her previous emotional abuse from her parents and former partner, it’s just something that can be so hard. 

I know I’m not a perfect man, but I know I tried really hard and I loved her so much. I still do, and I don’t believe love for her will ever diminish in the platonic sense. 

Maybe I should have let her go the first time that she wanted to break things off, a few months ago, but I wanted to fight for us and I knew that it wasn’t because she didn’t love me, but because of fear. She ended up getting counseling but when they recommended she see a psychiatrist and potentially seek meds, she was averse. Maybe that should’ve been the sign. I don’t regret it, though. We have had some beautiful times and our love was just great. What a wonderful woman she is. 

Lately, we’ve just had a moderate amount of arguments and disagreements. I don’t know if I just didn’t understand her or I was trying to take on too much by myself, but I knew that when I offered to go in half with her and try out couples counseling to see if we could work through this, learn where we’re both going wrong, learn how we can improve, and she refused and said she didn’t really know what she wanted, that it was time to let her go and that I had done all I could. 

We cuddled together in bed for one more night. I know we can’t do that anymore, but it was my last chance to be with her that way. And now I’m crying. 

So now, here I am. It’s official, we’re split. I need to treat her like a friend and never blur the line between that and romance while I figure out my feelings and work towards moving on. Obviously, I’m devastated, but there was a piece of me that braced myself for this possibility, since we’ve been through some troughs where I grieved our relationship. 

I feel sadness from losing someone I held so close to my heart. I feel no anger. I feel regret for the mistakes that I made in the relationship. I feel lonely. I also, in a way, feel relief. Maybe she will take away something positive from this. It is probably for the best and Maybe one day, when she finds herself, she will find someone like me, because she deserves all the love in the world. And here I am, crying again. I wish it were me who could love her and hold her. 

Someone please tell me how to get through this. This pain is too real.",0
279,"5 yr old’s first molar broke I’m really upset &amp; need to vent. Took my 5 yr old to the dentist not even 6 months ago for his cleaning. No cavities. Nice bc my teeth suck!! Anyways dentist says he is going to put a dental sealant on his molars since they pit in a bit &amp; food can get stuck in there. Nice! Extra protection right?!

This month I noticed on one of his molars a bit of discoloration, like a black spec but looked as if it was on the sealant and did not necessarily look like a cavity. Even if it was a cavity, I knew we were due for a 6 month cleaning anyways. Today I’m brushing his tooth and the molar has a 1/4 chunk gone. I can see the inside of the tooth all exposed. School starts in 2 days!

What pisses me of is I’m trying to figure out how the hell this happens? Go from no cavities to adding a sealant to full blown broken tooth exposed. I google dental sealants and see there are pros and cons to it. If it does not adhere to the tooth the right way or chips just a little, it leaves room for everything to leak in &amp; then gets trapped between the tooth and sealant leading to decay. So basically a “sealant fail” where a healthy tooth is now done. 

Not only am I pissed bc this didn’t need to happen, I’m scared! The tooth does not look like it’s going to need anything less than a root canal or extraction and wtf! I don’t want to put my baby to sleep. I’m just so pissed. Like, this didn’t need to happen. I understand the dentist wanted added protection to his healthy teeth but it literally did the opposite. And how did this damage happen so fast? Not even long enough to get to his next cleaning for his dentist to pick up on the damage going on. Shit. 

I will say, I know there are worse things going on in the world today and I am trying to find gratitude amongst my day to day stresses, I guess I’m really just scared about what the next step is for my baby. I know things can be worse. It just doesn’t help hearing the news of little kids going under at the dentist &amp; 😞 

How do I approach his dentist tomorrow?",1

1743,"Should I try or move on I had met my baby daddy in college 2 years ago. I (21 F) took a break from dating before I met my baby daddy(25M). A year passed from being single I met my baby daddy through a mutual friend and my mom forbidden from me going out with him because my brother hated him. He had texted my brother asking to meet with him and they had drinks together and I wasn’t aware they had met up until my brother told me. My brother simply hated him because of his car, stupid I know. That didn’t change for my mom she was very upset when the conversation would come up. 
Anyway we started dating in September 2019 and then found out I was pregnant last year in March 2020. Our relationship ended when we basically found out. I was working a lot during Covid and I was scared of getting covid because I was pregnant. I would always try my best to go to his hometown, which is 30 minutes away, to see and check up on him. We would text but it was just different. He was being very short and distant from me. On day I believe in late July 2020 I got into a car accident with a 18 wheeler, thankfully I was okay and so was my baby. He then asked me to stop going, so I did and it would worry me on how he was doing. We were on and off when I was pregnant because I felt like he wasn’t there for me. He could be next to me but wouldn’t acknowledge me and not really mentally all there. Before getting into the car accident I had gave him the choice of walking out and forget he has a child on the way and move on with his life, he said no. Then I asked him “do you want this baby?” And he said “honestly, no I don’t I’m not ready and you aren’t ready.” I didn’t say anything and just sat there and cried and just whipped my tears away because his dad was coming. I don’t think anyone is really ever ready to have kids. 
By our 1st anniversary we were together and then it was just different. He said that it was my fault because I would always leave him and break up with him. He was always there for the doctors appointment and bring me food, but he wasn’t mentally there for me. When I found out the gender of the baby I was so excited but he was just okay. So I just let him be and just got distant with him.
Fast forward to January 2021 we had our beautiful baby girl, he left the day she was born because he wasn’t feeling well. So I was alone by myself with zero sleep and in pain. March 2021 I quit my job because of wanting to be there for my daughter and my maternity leave was short due to my job almost causing me to have my daughter twice, and again I was alone both times. For one of the times I was in the hospital he was in town with friends and said he was going to go but never showed. 
He’s not a bad father and I’m grateful that he steps up for his daughter’s needs and at times my needs. I recently started working again and I never stopped attending school, but we aren’t together and he says he doesn’t know if he wants to be with me because I kept walking out. We had this friends with benefits relationship and we stopped, but he said we will just have to figure out how to work things out. I’m at the point where I’m not sure what to do anymore. He’s been unsure of me for awhile now and doesn’t show the effort or seem to care he wants to get back together, and I did want to get back together and would show and put effort, but then stopped and I’m not sure if I should just move on.",0
3184,"I (24F) don't know what I should do with my BF (22M) now... Quite a long post!
TLDR at the bottom.

We (22M, 24F) are doing LDR.
We started as an online relationship and after 6 months, we got to meet in person because I moved to his neighbor country for study.
Due to COVID, we lived together in his place.
But it was secret to my parents because of cultural reasons.
Living together is not something common at all in my country.

When we lived together there were some problems here and there sometimes it was not good at all, sometimes it was the best just like other couples.
There was a moment of me being emotionally exhausted with all the problems and pressure.
I was tired of lying to my parents every day.
One day I told my parents crying that I was staying in another country with my bf.
They paid for everything. Tuition fee, rent, allowance.
They told me it is a betrayal.
I had to go back and told my bf and his family to come back asap.
According to my bf, this was a choice that I chose my family over him, and he was angry that I did not even bargain with my parents saying if I can stay until his exams end.
(I said I don't want it to happen, so I will try, but in the end, if I need to choose between him and my family I said I would choose him.)

Finished 2 weeks of self-quarantine, after another week, I got accepted to a graduate school in his country. I told them and they were happy. And I thought I will be back in his country in August.

But BF told me to stay in my country making money and gain more independence until his graduation (1year) because he was afraid of me falling in love with someone else in that school.
I said it is the highest possible way for me to go there and stay.
He did not care.
It was choosing him or school.
I chose him.

After that, he started talking about how hard LDR is. 
Yes, it is hard, but there is literally no way for me to go there and stay because of the visa and COVID. 
One day he started saying he wants to talk with my parents and asking their numbers to tell them what he really wants with me and all, but I said no because they already think I am not taking care of my life and career as I stopped my study abruptly.
I never said I got affected by my bf, but in the situation of me having no plan, asking them to have a call with my bf was not a good idea.
I of course delivered to my parents that we want to get married, and they told me that get a job and have a stable income before discussing marriage.
I told him about this and he agreed.
This is also a point of him having more doubt of this relationship, as it will take years for him to have a stable job.

One day he gave me the ultimatum of ""LDR is not real, come back RN or break up""
I asked how about the visa, and he said to do it myself.
I felt very bad, and I was offended that now I became a person who just put him in a doubt bag when it was him who asked me to stay here.
Seems like he takes everything for granted, so I said ""let's stop, and you know there is no way for me to get a visa there because of COVID now.""

We talked and decided to get back together. 
At the same time, I am having a hard time ""forgiving"". This also includes his family. They did name-calling. (He told me none of them meant it but still, it is hard for me to forgive and move on TBH, but I am trying) Also, there was stuff that I got hurt from my bf. I know that keep talking about the past is my problem, and I am doing counseling also to solve this problem.

He wants to live with me asap and yes I want it too.
But there are practical problems now.
Visa, Money, Job, etc.

He said, ""It feels like I'm going to wait years for nothing in the end. And it's not like years together that we enjoy, but it's years of waiting for nothing""

He keeps saying he feels alone and lonely.
I asked him how he thinks we can close the distance.
He said he does not know.
I said it is either me coming to him or him coming to me or us going to the different country.
He said he cannot move right now because of the school and I said it is the same for me, but I will at least visit him this November.
I asked him if he can come to my country after graduation and meet my parents in person. He said he wants to, but he also said he does not think they will not let us live alone.
I feel like he does not even want to make an effort of visiting here and just wants me to come to him and live with him.

Sometimes he asks me when I will come back and he thinks it seems like I will never come back...
I mean it was him who asked me to stay here for a year... and now I felt like he is saying I am in my country just because I wanted to. 
I became like a mother who abandoned her child.

He is saying my parents keep blocking him from keep doing LDR with me.
He said seems like I know it is dead-end but just blackmailing him.
My brother is also in a relationship with a foreigner and yes my parents are not that happy with it BUT the basic stance of my parents is that nationality is not a problem but them not knowing about my brother's girlfriend is a problem. (There were indeed lots of suspicious thing about her tbh)

I don't know if you guys can understand the whole situation...
Maybe I am only thinking of my side...

TLDR
Long distance relationship.
BF asked me not to go graduate school and stay in my country and make money.
I did not go to school and now he is saying he wants me to come back and LDR is too hard. He keeps saying he is tired of waiting without a real way to know if I really want to end up with him. I am also waiting... Both of us are waiting...",0

1616,"My (33F) incredible partner (32M) was extremely unenthusiastic about marriage and I don't know how to move past the hurt. How do I let this go? I  am sad, confused, and would love some advice - apologies for length, but you fine folk may have the insights I need.

*context: I don't subscribe to ideas about marriage making life (esp. women's lives) complete, and have been somewhat suspicious of marriage as a 'default' goal my entire life. Now that I really want it with a particular person, this stance is definitely feeding into my neuroses.* 

I (33F) have been dating 'Bruce' (32M) for just under 2 years and it has been fantastic. We were friends for 8 years before that. Started dating weeks before the apocalypse arrived and we lived in cities very far apart, so between the panny and established friendship our relationship had an extremely 'all in' energy from day 1. He didn't hesitate to pack up his life and move to my city when covid numbers permitted, and we are nested here for a couple more years. Maybe it was being in our 30s and knowing what we want for ourselves, but from the first date we've been talking about long term plans. This includes: wanting kids together (he's destined to be a phenomenal dad &amp; I know he would support me in every step of the process) and buying a home (near his charming family in a gorgeous part of the country I've always wanted to live in). Despite the pandemic both our careers are taking off in a huge way. Our timelines are matched up and we want all this within 5 years. The sex is bananas good. I am so in love with this effervescent, sweet man and he is so good to me. 

The problem:  We've been circling the drain for months now over a single very high-stakes issue.   

About 9 months into dating (during a very happy moment) I asked him ""do you want to get married?"" expecting a guaranteed affirmative, given the other conversations. He was visibly uncomfortable and responded, verbatim: ""not anytime soon"". I was hurt but respected his boundary, so waited a few months before bringing it up again. That conversation was longer, but boiled down to: *he wasn't ready to have even the initial conversation.* I wasn't getting an outright no, because I wasn't getting anything at all. The problem is, it was the biggest elephant in every room after that. I'm 33 and I don't need to be pregnant asap (kind of terrified of it), but he wants bio-kids and practically, I don't have that much time to figure this out.  I didn't need the perfect answer, but I needed that conversation to happen. We are in our 30's, live together, and are talking about bigger commitments than marriage alone on the immediate horizon.  

So... I pursued the issue more. I tried honestly *everything*. Brought it up as a calm but serious convo we needed to have. Made light hearted comments about it hoping he would adopt the same tone. Eventually suggested I could propose to him if planning was the really stressful part of it, or we could do a city hall elopement. I am pretty non-traditional (or at least I thought so) and made clear an expensive wedding/ring/process is not my goal. Advocated for my above concerns... each and every time he was ambiguous. I was extra frustrated for a few reasons: He has an art career I support 100% but it is precarious and unstable. I'm the breadwinner with the equity established to buy us a place (will sell my own condo) and we are planning to move close to *his* family. I am willing to make career compromises for these goals and going to be the one bearing the physical brunt of kids and tbh there's no coming back from that choice. In short, I'm putting *all I have* into this relationship (and gladly so!) but his anxious, vague and often inconsistent responses felt like outright rejections over a sensitive topic. We do, indeed, live in a society, and maybe worst of all, I haaaaated feeling like a 'biological clock' parody of a woman in her 30's forcing this conversation (I swear I'm not a 'pick me/not like other girls' person, just trying to be vulnerable about my own hangups here). It snowballed and we started earnestly arguing. 

Now we've been in couples therapy about it for a few weeks and it turns out this has been happening because he has deep anxiety and self esteem issues - I believe him and want to be supportive, but they are ONLY manifesting over the marriage issue, which is the one big commitment he would need to make *equally* with me. Zero anxiety or ambiguity has come up about any of my major material or physical commitments to our goals - those are all enthusiasm. He now says he feels like he's turned a corner via therapy and wants us to get married and work through it all with a big smile together.

But... this has been *a really* unrewarding process for me and I feel awful. Now that I've been forced to advocate for myself for months, go to therapy over it, and coax him to take it seriously, the mood around the topic feels so incredibly cynical -  nothing about it feels optimistic, romantic, sweet or intimate. I felt really vulnerable and hurt for over 8 months over this, and his avoidance meant something I hoped would be precious became a long and painful reckoning process. He doesn't know how to fix it and neither do I, but we both want to. 

What can we do to salvage the playfulness, hope and joy I felt that first time I brought it up? Can we at all, or do I just settle for less sparkle and do the damn thing anyways? Or maybe abandon the prospect entirely and just lovingly co-parent like the progressive I think I am? I'm not vehemently opposed... but I'm not excited about this version of our future like I once was.

492,"3 year old acting out after new baby My family has recently expanded and we now have a 3 week old baby girl. Our 3 year old boy is still adjusting, as he has never had to share the attention before. He has started yelling “no” and refusing to every request.

He has also been chasing the dog and has hit her twice now. ☹️ I feel like all of this is his way of trying to get our attention in whatever way he can.

2933,"[21 M] I'm killing my family [64 M - 58 F] I have always been ugly. Since I was a teen, I began to get bullied due to being ugly and autistic. I had no real friends, and those who possed as such, bullied me because of my unattractiveness and poor social skills (I went to a mental health associstion for kids from 8 to 15, to have normal social skills, but my looks weren't good enough). 

The bullying moved from place to place, so it wasn't just from the people I knew from 13 to 15, but from most average and good-looking people. Now I have a small friend circle that don't bully me anymore (they're as ugly as me, so maybe that's a reason). 

I always had a hard time with talking to girls because of hard rejections (""worst she can say is no"", is just a fallacy that privileged people spit. Worst she can do is misstreat you for your aducaity and laugh at you with her friends. I dislike women). 

Anyways, I began to develop a severe case of BDD a year ago after a long time trying to cope with unattractiveness. I started to self-harm because of my looks, and that hurts my parents a lot. 

Today I started to scream random insults while punching my body and face (I was imagining that I was making these girls and guys that call me ugly deformed by punching them) and my mother was really scared. Then, she started crying and saying that she wanted to end her life. We're all really tired of this situation, and I don't know what to do. I have tried therapy, but it's hard to cope with something that will make your life harder than many people (specially when you're autistic). I want my parents too be happy. What can I do to make them happy?

**TL;DR** I'm ugly and my bitterness is making my parents suffer. I want that to stop.",0
795,"Sleeping issues for giant babies? Our son is 5 months old. He was born 10lbs (4.5kg) and is just over double that size now. We’re having worsening problems getting him to sleep these last two months. Everything seemed to be going fine until he got a viral rash at 3 months. It only lasted 3 days but since then his sleeping pattern has deteriorated and become more and more inconsistent.

He now absolutely needs to feed before sleeping, including daytime naps. If we don’t feed him he will scream and scream until he isn’t tired anymore. He just finished screaming for an hour and now he’s playing beside me. We don’t want to let him cry for more than half an hour because he can develop a hernia (my wife’s nephew had this happen).

At night he will sleep for 3-4 hours before needing a feeding, then he will wake up every 1-2 hours and need a feeding to fall asleep again. He’s down to only 1-2 naps during the day. As soon as he’s even slightly tired he will cry until his mom holds him. I used to be able to get him to sleep easily but these last two months he’s started to need more and more comfort items and conditions in order to fall asleep.

Some people have told us that since he’s so big he needs more feedings which is why he isn’t sleeping so if any of you also have giant babies maybe you could share your thoughts? 

We’re trying to play with him more during the day to wear him out but we usually wear out faster than he does. 

He’s perfectly healthy otherwise but his mom is exhausted. We’ve tried a bunch of different methods to help him sleep better but we’re totally open to hearing more ideas so feel free to share.",1

253,"AITA for making family time required for teenagers? BLUF: Is requiring teenagers to take part in family time abuse?

At dinner I told my kids that we were going to do an hour of outdoor family time after dinner. The two teenagers (16 and 13) groaned and said they had too much stuff to do such as homework, shower, put away laundry, tidy their rooms, etc., and I told them that 2.5 hours would be plenty of time for that. The younger three (10, 5, and 3) were excited. I talked to them about what they wanted to do and then tried to see if the older two would say what would be fun for them outside. They continued to complain and try to come up with excuses. My wife said she wouldn't be going outside, so I asked what she was going to do instead, but she resisted and this apparently caused some discontent.

Dinner finished, and the older kids tried their usual disappearing act. I found them and said they needed to get outside. They gave me their excuses and complaints, but I told them it was not optional. Eventually they came outside and I said phones would be put away. While playing with the younger kids, I tried to coax out of the older two what kinds of things they would enjoy during this time and said it was going to be a regular thing for us. Only got complaining and pouting for the whole hour.

My wife decided to handwash all the dirty dishes during the family hour (we usually use the dishwasher), and afterwards engaged me saying that it was abusive to force them to do family time. I asked for clarification, and was told it was actual abuse, not just a figure of speech. She said it would drive a wedge between them and us and that she wouldn't go along with it. I said that letting them be isolated in their rooms on their phones for far too many hours a day would lead to driving them away as they would not feel connected to us and that it might actually be neglect. Obviously, we have issues between us to work out and the argument went to other areas, but I just wanted y'alls take:

Is forcing (not physically, but there would be consequences for not participating) my teenagers to be present for family time abuse?

Just to note: this is something I have tried to implement for some time but have not been able to get my wife on board. Encouraging the teenagers has not worked before. I decided to just implement it and mostly ignore the whinging teens and what I read said to expect that at first anyway.",1

1912,"My girlfriend is seeking attention from someone else (while in the middle of a hurricane crisis) 
(Disclaimer: Not my story, it's my friend's situation. This will be told from his perspective. Yes, he gave me consent to make this post, he actually asked me to do it.)

My friend is 17 (finna be 18 in 2 weeks) and she is 16 (finna be 17 inna month or so). The relationship been goin on for about 3+ years. 

I want to start this off by saying...my girlfriend is pretty insecure. I reside in Laplace and we just got hit by our worst hurricane to date; but somehow she still finds a way to give me problems. I went to my female neighbors house to help them with their roof, cook sum food (cuz I have no power), and just relax in A/C. She has my location, so when she asked where I was I said, ""I'm at Alyssa's house"" and she got mad at me for just being at another female's house. I wasn't flirting nor was I interested, but she told me to leave and go to her at her grandma's house (where she also has power, A/C, etc.) So I went. While I was there, she showed me a tiktok. A text notification popped up from Aaron. (Context: Aaron is my girlfriend's coworker who, according to her, was ""harassing"" her and trying to get with her). I clicked it and read a text from her saying ""I miss you too"" but I couldn't find any conversation before that text. Immediately when I seen it, I questioned her because this look sus. When I asked, she grinned (as if she fucked up or something) and said, ""I was looking for attention."". I asked if I wasn't enough and she tried to make it out to be not a big deal or whatever. I was fed up at this point, so I left. As soon as I was in my truck, trying to leave, she started crying. (Keep in mind she had a straight face the entire time before that) As soon as I leave, she starts texting me, saying all the right words like, ""I trust you"" (even though she said in the past that she doesn't, and continues to show me that she doesn't), ""I want a future with you"", ""I'll quit my job for you"" and things of that nature. At this point, I'm over the relationship. She done shit like this in the past, and I took her back every time, but this time, I can't. 

He wants advice on whether or not he should stay again or finally be done with her.

From my perspective, I've been telling him to end the relationship. I believe she's a master manipulator and that he deserves better. And he's experienced better but yet he's loyal so he stayed. Ever since then its been issue after issue, until now.",0

2212,"I (24f) don't know how to trust my boyfriend (39m) of two years again after a really bad experience when we were still polyamorous Ok I am incredibly ashamed of the whole situation and I feel like it is messy as hell.

I met my current boyfriend at the age of 22 at work. He was 37 at the time. We took it kind of slow in the beginning and decided on an open relationship because I just had ended a monogamous short term relationship with an extremely clingy person and didn't want to miss out on meeting new people. The boyfriend in question also brought a long term girl friend with him, they had been on and off and in different stages of their relationship for around 7 years. 

At this time when we still got to know each other he down played the role of the other girlfriend a lot and told me that their partnership was about to end due to deep rooted problems on her side and their lack of acknowledging it sooner. He didn't even call her girlfriend, they didn't have a label per se but it seemed caring and as if there was a decent degree of responsibility for each other. I would call what they had a fuck buddy kind of thing. But you know real buddies instead of only sex in a no strings attached style. He described the sex as the best he's ever had, like gold standard, which made me feel insecure. I kind of wished for something similar with him. Good sex and reliability, yet a certain amount of distance.

I was also relieved that there was another person so that the whole burden of being a girlfriend and that someone else was there to meet his needs.  
At the same time both of us knew that whatever we had was not just a fling but felt rather serious and compatible.

As soon as he told her that he wanted to persue a commited relationship with me she cut ties. He didn't want to push her out of the poly constellation or anything but she felt like he was dropping her for a new and more exciting person.  
Her absence wasn't long, after a week or so she came back. This kind of pattern repeated itself for a few month. She claimed to be done with him and blocked his number only to crawl back after a few days or he got back in touch with her.

Turned out their relationship was way more complicated than I had thought. At first I tried to give advice like ""maybe you should give each other time to find out what you want"" from a perspective of a friend. I didn't want him all to myself or anything but it really destabilized my relationship with him because I never knew what would happen next. They fought, they made up, they swore to never contact each other again and did so a few days later. They tried improving the nonsexual parts of their relationships by not sleeping with each other only to be able to continue to have amazing sex later on.   
At some point I didn't want to be a witness to whatever they were doing to each other. I didn't want to be part of a toxic constellation. He was very adament about us taking this relationship serious and planning a future together. He also wanted us to be in an exclusive relationship.

Their back and forth went on for the better part of a year. When I told him after a few weeks of no contact with her that I was warming up to the thought of him seeing her again he took it as a green light for doing whatever he wanted. 

So they arranged a hiking date which I was aware of and it would end at her place where they would cook and have sex. Eventhough it was a little scary for me to not be able to speak with him about the experience for the whole day as they were up on a mountain I felt confident and okay with them meeting and being intimate. They've had been intimate with each other before but this was after a pause and in a rocky situation so I was little overwhelmed with the lenght of their date. What I wasn't okay with (and unfortunately we hadn't discussed this part beforehand) was him sleeping at her house. So I wrote him that if it wasn't planned out already and therefor non of my business I wouldn't feel comfortable with that.

So long story short: he slept at her house dispite me stating that this crossed my boundaries. What followed was a terrible time of me bawling my eyes out, no trust in him whatsoever. When he saw my reaction he felt sorry. But soon after he justified his actions by saying that my message wasn't clear.

I really hurt in the weeks after and he was still meeting up with her. At first he didn't do anything intimate with her because I asked him not to until we had sorted our feelings out. But he began pushing boundaries again like ""I didn't kiss her, at least not on the mouth but it was a physically intimate date, yes"".

It made me realize that I didn't want this level of commitment with another women in the picture. So for me there were three options: leaving him, downgrading our label and changing the expectations that came with it or closing the relationship which he had stated to want for a few month at this point.

He wasn't satisfied with either of these solutions and still tried to impliment the other woman into the semi committed train wreck we had. Not as a secondary but another full time girlfriend. This further took away my trust in him listening to my needs and respecting my boundaries.

At some point I did break up with him because I felt left alone with the aftermath and still wasn't sure on what to expect from him and his other girlfriend. In the time we were not together he broke up with her as far as I remember. He came to the conclusion that he didn't want the same level of committment with her as she was looking for in him.

We got back together a few weeks later. Went monogamous. Went to couples therapy.   
I had nightmares and panic attacks when I was sleeping next to him for half a year. But the relationship did improve eventually.

A year has passed since the night that broke my trust. And we did grow closer as a couple in the meantime. Sex is good, communication is fine, we enjoy each others company and know and like each others parents. This is my first real relationship and it really seems to work in a lot of ways.

But the problem is my fear in regards of this other woman. There were a few instances where they contacted each other or met in public by coincidence. And everytime he mentions that he would love to know how she is doing, meeting her for coffee at some point in the future I take ten steps back and feel like the whole relationship is up in the air again. I am repelled by him and the person he was with her. I don't want to be touched by him and consider to end the relationship everytime he talks about her.  
The funny thing is that the other woman is about to move in with her new boyfriend, they are also exclusive.  
So not only have our rules changed, she is also not available. 

Logically I know that meeting your ex for coffee is no big deal. My divorced parents also went on vacation together a few years later. Being friends with an ex is the norm for me.

But I fear that my boundaries might be crossed again at some point and that it will be completely out of my control. That even if I say ""no"" to something he will disregard it for his own benefit.

I am so fucking afraid. And I don't want to live with this fear anymore, I don't want to feel like I did last year ever again. 

Even if he meets up with her and nothing happens I am afraid my fear won't go away.   
He also occasionally sees another exgirlfriend of his and I have no problem with her. But since I've had this experience with him and the other woman I don't trust him.

There is nothing he can do to prove that it won't happen again. But I also don't want to live with this intense fear, reliving the same devestating situation over and over again.  
This erodes our relationship and it is just exhausting to have to pick up the pieces everytime he mentions her name and potential friendly contact. The fear wipes away every warm or loving feeling I have towards him. 

Does anyone know how to deal with the fear?  
What kind of emotional support can I expect from my partner in this situation?  
Or did we fuck this up one year ago and should be parting ways?",0
2721,"My(30F) Boyfriends [M] Daughter (30F) is Same Age As Me  

I am expecting to get a lot of nasty comments on this one but I'm hoping maybe just a few pieces of good advice.

I've been seeing my boyfriend for a 3 years now, and it's been a rather complicated one. Can't go into specific details because I don't need this coming back to me so I'm omitting things.

Boyfriend is a lot older than me, but I am 30. Not a fresh 21 year old. We've kept our relationship secret because his daughter is the same age as I am. He eventually told her early this year and she couldn't cope with it - she started crying, threatening to keep his grandchild away if she deemed me not ""worthy enough"" and suggested she may disown him. Banned me from ever setting foot on any family property or get togethers, but happily invited herself into our home where we live together... though I was downstairs. Unannounced. I stayed away, I didn't say a word. Her issue, was something along the lines of ""what will people think"".

No offense, this family is not famous. At all. They are just, regular people like you and I. And I am a very salt of the earth type of person - I don't take many things in life very seriously. Especially the ""sanctity of the family prestigious-ness"" or whatever weird concept she has in her head.

He refused to tell her to grow up, and she started calling him constantly to come over every other night and weekend, leaving me at home. He wouldn't miss a single opportunity to leave and go see his family (normal, right, except who leaves their SO?). I eventually blew up and posted our relationship on Facebook and she took that as a direct insult. She found another social media platform I was on, and sent me a threatening message. I called her crazy. Boyfriend broke up with me.

Yeah, I know, wasn't a smart move on my part. My excuse was I had spent a couple of **years** already waiting patiently in the dark while he went off constantly to see family and friends while I was left behind.

After a few weeks, I took him back and we are dating secretly, again. And I hate it. I feel as if his daughter is his boss and the boss of our relationship. He's terrified of taking me anywhere except out for dinner somewhere. We don't go out, we don't hang out with friends, we do nothing except stay at home and watch the box.

Meanwhile, he's partying every weekend at his kid's house or his cottage which I'm not allowed to attend. He told me he needs to tell his family in his own time, but I'm looking at my 3rd Christmas completely alone since I am estranged from my father, my brothers, and my mother's husband doesn't allow her out. That's a whole other situation I'm not getting into. Just know I have an extremely toxic family so I have gone no contact for a long time now.

I was hoping he would include me in his life instead of just at home for sex, cooking and watching movies.

We talk constantly about this, but he has a hard time admitting his daughter threw the first spear and attacked me right away. I've told him I feel completely lonely, like a loser, unvalued, small, and that I'm frustrated. And he tells me, there is nothing he can do. That he's sorry, that I'm a roller coaster, and that he can't make anyone do anything. I'm not asking him to do anything, except put his foot down and include me. Take me SOMEWHERE, anywhere! I'm young, I just got healthy again! He is a lovely man; he's hilarious, he's attentive in the moment, we enjoy each other's company and does not make me feel like I am unsafe in my own home like I have experienced in the passed. I feel safe with him, and we fit very well. He claims he wants to marry me, but that's as far as he gets. He shuts down after that. Yes, I suggested recently somewhere to go after I got back to the house...he leaves for 4 hours to go to her place, whole day shot.

What would you do in my case? I do not have friends either because of how sick I have been for 15 years, and only now am I able to go outside without being bedridden. I have tried to cultivate friendships especially around my dogs but I'm tired of every friend cancelling me on the last minute.

I enjoy hikes with my dogs, and this summer it was too hot to go anywhere with them thus keeping me indoors, and then our winters are absolutely brutal for a good 8 months of the year.

This is really a cry for just some help here, I feel completely left behind by everyone.  


TL:DR Boyfriend won't include me in any family activities or introduce me to his friends after 3 years together. Or take me anywhere except for a dinner.",0
749,"2 year old nap time My daughter has always had a *very* consistent nap schedule. Then, coincidentally, the exact day she turned 2 years old, she stopped wanting to nap. She refuses and will toss all of her stuffed animals out of her crib, and then scream bloody murder. (We haven’t switched to a toddler bed yet, but plan to soon. We’ve never had problems with her climbing out so we haven’t felt the need) We thought maybe well if she don’t need a nap then so be it, but by the time 6:30 rolls around she’s so tired and cranky it makes the evening that much harder. 

We’ve been putting her to bed an hour earlier with no problems so maybe that is just the best option. Just looking for some additional input/suggestions. Thanks in advance",1
2461,"Need advice !! I am a F (19) and have lived with my boyfriend for a year (M 21). I really need advice here. I am supposed to be attending a funeral with my boyfriend this weekend for his brothers tragic death about a week ago. It has obviously had a huge effect on him and his family. I have been here for him as much as I can and his family as been a big support as well. This is important because today I woke up early and saw him receive a Snapchat notification from a girl. I opened his phone which I don’t usually do, and saw that he has been sliding up on females Snapchat posts saying “yo” as if he wants to initiate a conversation. These messages were within the past 24 hours and days before as well, but the full messages were not saved so I’m not sure what was said. Before anyone says this is not cheating, my boyfriend and I have very clear boundaries of what we allow in our relationship. We both know that we shouldn’t be talking to other people especially ones we don’t know, and especially behind each other’s back. I haven’t noticed him doing this before now. I am really disrespected and hurt that he wants to talk with these females. It’s taking everything in me to not bring this up to him, because I know he would to me. I don’t want to argue before his brothers funeral but I feel like I shouldn’t wait to say something because I don’t like to suppress my feelings. What should I do, confront him or wait until after the funeral?

Tl;dr Found out my boyfriend has been initiating conversations with unknown females lately and am hurt. Should I wait to confront him before or after his brothers funeral?",0

i have a couple severe mental illnesses, i won’t get into them but they are debilitating in my every day life. 
my son is almost 2 and i love him, very much but i don’t feel that “ohmygod my kid is my everything” that i see from other parents. i watched a video of a couple finding out they were pregnant. they got 3 negative tests before finally getting a positive one and they were in shock and awe. it made me cry
i didn’t feel that way when i got pregnant. my now husband and i actually planned on getting an abortion but his mother played a VERY big role in us keeping the baby. when he was born, i didn’t feel an immediate connection to him and once we took him home, i actually started resenting him for making my life so much harder. i didn’t think about the long term affects of a child before i had him. 
i’m not a very good parent, i’m not an active parent. i do bare minimum. 
i still catch myself thinking “why the fuck did i do this?” and it makes me hate myself. i’m so depressed bc i just can’t relate with him. 
i do truly love him but i don’t always feel anything toward him like i feel i should. 
my husband and i have grown apart bc we both don’t understand how to handle the decision we made. we’re both depressed and lash out at each other. 
i don’t know how to get out of these feelings.
i would NEVER give him up. i would die before i let someone take my baby and that lets me know that i do feel SOME kind of connection to him but in day to day life, i don’t know. it’s all so confusing and complicated. 
has anyone else had like postpartum that has lasted this long? i can only assume that’s what it is based on my research and talking to my doctor. i just don’t know what to do with these feelings.",0

Have two daughters. One of them is from her previous relationships.. 

She was never married to kids father. Does that mean she has a sole custody ?  
Father is around.. Picks her up from time to time.. Never gave a penny to support his child.. I never asked , cause i don't need to , i raised her like my own. So it was friendly come and go.. Until recently my wife asked his permission to take her out of country since we wanted to go on vocation in EUROPE..And she red that she needs his permission ..Father out of nowhere said no..Because he doesn't feel like she needs to go on vocation with us :)   


I googled..That you only can take your kid out of the country if you have SOLE custody..We never went to court...And they never been married..I also google if parents never been married..So mother automatically gets SOLE CUSTODY in state of IL...

Can we go on vocation without FATHERs permission if they never been married ..And kid always been living with us ..?",1
1915,"Heartbreak and Drama. Should I text or call and try again? I met this girl (21f) on tinder in November 2020. We started hooking up regularly and had amazing chemistry. She hinted at exclusivity early on by asking if Im seeing anyone else but we both were playing stupid games and never really talked about it. We tried to make each-other jealous and both act aloof. She was seeing other people and from what she would post it was clear so I decided to hookup with another girl who I had known previously. She then posted stories of other guys drinking. I regretted hooking up with another girl and said enough is enough. We had a big talk and she admitted that she loved me, I said it too, then we agreed not to see anyone else and take things slow.

We were great and fell really inlove and had amazing dates and I felt like she was my soulmate. She was so crazy about me and would text me all the time and say I love you and be so happy to see me. We had a fight because she was partying with a bunch of guys till 3am and not telling me about it so I became uncomfortable. When we “split up” I downloaded tinder and matched with her friend. She found out but then we made up and continued dating. I graduated college and moved 3hours away. I then became super insecure and jealous and saw that she would like, comment, and follow guys that she previously had flings with before we met. I kept being jealous and I knew going forward we would be long distance so I ended things with her on the phone. She was DEVASTATED. I was so upset too but being home in my abusive house put a lot of stress on me and I felt I couldnt deal with the added stress of long distance.

We still kept in touch and she clearly missed me.  She kept messaging but I started not to respond. Then I receive a long text from my previous OLD ex from 4 years ago. That ex is not kind and harassed me before, has faked pregnancy etc. She says the two of my exes have been in contact and they say fuck you in the letter, Im emotionally abusive, im a narcissist, and its clearly written by the old ex. And is very demeaning. Also it says they are mad I took them on the same dates, told them the same info about myself and make fun of my music, and personality. My recent ex reached out to her and Im not sure why. Maybe for closure but she knew how toxic that girl was to me.

Then my recent ex said she wanted to talk and that she didnt write the letter. I said no and I blocked both of them. Then my recent ex found a way to message me saying she found out I hooked up with that girl previously when we weren’t exclusive. She believes it was after we became exclusive and claims I cheated on her and she says she wishes I go to hell etc. thats not true though, it was before we were exclusive. I blocked. 

Im miserable and I love her so much and know I shouldve never broken up with her for jealousy. Any advice I think I want her back and I miss her so much. Ive been crying a lot today.",0

659,"What to do with only child who hasn't socialized with other toddlers since pandemic? My daughter was 2.5 when pandemic started and she has not socialized with anyone her age since (before that would see some cousins). The closest would be her 16 year old aunt but otherwise it's my wife and I. Her grandparents as well since everyone got vaccinated.

She's seen kids around when we do outdoor activities (park, beach, walks) but not much else. At the beach this summer a nice girl similar age was talking to her but my daughter didn't talk back and talked to me instead.

We don't know anyone else through all this with kids that we felt safe with. For instance, her cousins are a similar age but that family is careless and remains unvaccinated.

We had hoped though that perhaps this summer if cases were low again we would feel comfortable having our daughter participate some stuff even though she's in unvaccinated. Unfortunately, with delta variant going around and our area being a hotspot, we are at a loss.

Is anyone else in a similar situation? Heck, even pre pandemic, what about only children who didn't go to pre school?

Are there ways to have our daughter socialize via zoom or perhaps safer outdoor activities we should consider?

We assume the vaccine won't be for another 6 months and just starting to fear that she has been going too long without socializing with kids her age. She'll be 3.5 at that point.

Any advice appreciated. Not looking to debate about the risks of COVID here though so don't want it to devolve into that.",1

Of her dads choice he lives 9 hours away in another state (has since 2012) and only visits 24 hours for her birthday in August, and I send her down there for 3 days at Christmas. Otherwise no phone calls, letters, texts etc. ever at all. This is all his choice, he says its hard emotionally to stay in contact with her. This is how it has been since we divorced in 2012 when she was 1.

When he comes up here he stays in a hotel, which is fine...better than my house. And when she was younger it was cool that she slept in his bed I guess. But now that she's 10 with C cup boobs and a period I just don't think they need to be A) staying in a hotel together and B) Sleeping in the same bed.

Before I bring this up to him for next year I wanted to see how crazy this makes me sound first lol. Does anyone else think this is now not appropriate?

We were inseparable for months on end we would see eachother literally 5/6 times a week and I always felt she just wanted me around she always wanted me to come over more and more and I loved the sense of want and love
Recently since we’ve both gotten jobs she’s been less drawn to seeing me anymore, she doesn’t seem to push to wanna see me it’s always me organising and often or not she’ll just call of the plans with very short notice
I overlook this cause she’s busy and she has her own life but everything has gone from 5/6 times a week to lucky to get to see her once
When I see her now she’s less in the moment and is always playing on her phone and either leaves early in the day just to stay at home alone or suggests me to leave early
She’s been withdrawn physically too, we are such a young couple me 18 and her 18 but we haven’t had any sexual contact in over two months, I find it hard to get her to kiss me sometimes unless it’s a quick one and done and she doesn’t wannna cuddle me anymore,
She rarely messages me back takes like an hour or more a day so I barely talk and when we’re both free to call she’s quick to end it causes she’s tired or something
She also recently which we’ve talked about is become very close with work friends which is great but one guy in particular who crops up in conversation a lot, I seen on her phone she had created a private story with only him in it and now regularly turns her snap location off and for a while her iOS location when it was her idea for us both to turn them on

I have tried my absolute best at reassuring him that I would never cheat on him and my free time, attention, and love is only for him and whenever he may need it; even to the point of letting him see all of my text conversations at any time. He’s fully aware of everything I do on a daily basis -where I am, who I’m with, and when I’ll be home- but is still extremely insecure whenever anything “sus” happens between me and any other person male or female, wether it be a simple poke of a dirty joke or absolutely normal compliments.

Context: yes he’s always been suspicious of everyone, even his sister at one point (I’m bi). But recently he had this “grudge” that a coworker of mine was into me and that was the reason he kept wanting to hang out with me. (With 5-7 other people at the same time, dude is a DJ and throws parties often) I’d always bring a friend with me and even take pics and videos of myself throughout the night and send them to my now-ex. He (now-ex) looked through my phone and saw multiple exchanges where we joked with each other, sometimes touching dirty jokes such as him inviting me and a couple others out to drink, using the Mexican term for drinking being chupar (directly translated as “sucking”) and me obviously knowing what it meant but being painfully obvious that I was being dumb on purpose responding with “chupar? 👀”. No the conversation did not get further than that. He laughed, got back into topic. Had a great night with those friends that night. No one hit on anyone. Nor has he ever hit on me.",0

I met this man years ago, we have amazing chemistry but we were suppose to only be a one night stand. However,  we stopped talking.

He's made me feel myself, made me change my perspective on dating after an abusive relationship and when I'm with him I feel like I'm home. I was there through his breakup, we have hung out numerous times and I slipped that I've always loved him... I know that's weird to say but this has been going on for almost 7 years. I completely distanced myself last time because I wanted the best for him. The weirdest thing about it, is we have never kissed.... I mean never. But have had sex and oral. Have held each other, slept in the same bed, held hands etc .
 He's going through some changes in his life with medication, sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety after his break up and I told him regardless we'd always be friends. He's never had food relationships or friendships where someone actually cares for him.  But I've been dropping him off food, things he needs, doesn't need or care packages to make sure he is okay. He's not a texter, so I understand if he doesn't want to text me or call etc. I feel I'm being pushy, but I've never felt this way about someone and I was even married. I decided to give him alot of space and was reading about love bombing, but I also feel because all my relationships with men in the past were horrible that I'm trying to make up for something I've never experienced with someone. I'm confused mentally and emotionally because he's made comments 'you were meant to be in my life""etc....I know wholeheartedly I want the best for this man in every aspect of life even if I'm not involved.",0

We are very excited as we have waited for this moment for a long time. With becoming parents comes a lot of responsibilities and sleepless nights and we are ready for that as well. We have already started to make a list of things we need to get and I know we won't capture everything but have to start somewhere and learn along the way. 

Of course, the top of the list is Diapers and Wipes and I wanted to ask what the general recommendation is for Diapers and Wipes for the baby? We have narrowed down our options to **Huggies and Pampers**. Visiting a local store today, we notice the prices are pretty similar, but I have read in the past that if you are a Costco Member, that's the best way to go and also get the best bang for your buck. In the end, the cost is not a problem, I just want what is the best for babies :)

So for all the parents out there, please share your thoughts on this topic and if you have any advice for our new journey that we will begin soon, share that as well. Thank you all for your time and help with this question. Your time and help are really appreciated.",1

The schools in my town never opened for full five days a week as the teachers signed a petition to have a sick out because they are afraid of working full time. I’m worried with this delta variant that the new school year will be more of the same.  

I feel like this quarantine is the last straw. Our jobs don’t care and I need to work my normal schedule. When I got home I checked my work email to a bunch of angry emails from people mad I was not at work to complete tasks (my boss told me it was OK to leave). It’s a very toxic environment because everyone is stretched so thin. It would be so much easier if I quit my job and stayed home. I have been holding on this entire pandemic thinking it will end soon and my girl will finally be back at school full time, but this will never end.  My husband doesn’t want me to quit as I do make a decent salary at a good job. He thinks it would be bad to walk away from that. He also doesn’t want the stress of being the breadwinner as he doesn’t feel secure at his current job.

Help, am I crazy to quit my job after toughing it out this far?",1
955,"Actual leak-proof water bottles to sleep with? Please help So my 1.5 year old's new thing is to sign that she's hungry when going down for bed time.....and also waking up in the middle of the night multiple times throwing a tantrum (full body flailing and throwing herself all over) right off the bat and finally aggressively signing that she's hungry.

First thing we did was say okay, let's get you some food. That's not actually the issue. She's not hungry. (Been doing this a few nights now) But she wants her sippy cup or water bottle and she wants to take a sip and then cuddle and hold it.

Okay, whatever. I don't care if she sleeps with a water bottle and wakes up to take a sip. That's fine. The issue is all her cups and bottles leak. Even the leak-proof ones.

So does anyone have any actual leak-proof &amp; cuddle-drink-at-anytime water bottles or sippy cups?",1
1664,"My Boyfriend (34M) has decided that before he proposes to me (30F) his financial goals must come first. Hello- I am a first time poster, so please be kind, I'm not completely sure how this all works. I'm posting because I need advice on how to deal with my relationship moving forward. I feel as if I am at a standstill and I have nowhere to turn. I can't ask my family or friends for advice on this matter, as I feel like it might make them dislike my boyfriend, who is quite universally liked and/or loved by most of the people who I would usually turn to. I would hate to complain in my personal life and have it muddy anything up further.

Some important background info: BF (34M) and I (30F) have been together for over 7 years. A bit more than half of that time, we have been living together. He's not the most lovey-dovey guy on the planet, but he is kind, good-natured, we share the same sense of humour, enjoy each other's company, hardly ever fight, and have similar interests. I truly love him more than I've ever loved anyone- which makes this whole situation all the more complicated. He is very well established in a good field at work, and his employment was not at all affected by COVID lockdowns. If anything, COVID gave him the ability to work more hours, and he quite frequently took advantage of overtime opportunities. I on the other hand, work in the restaurant industry. In my area, we have been affected by lockdowns on more than one occasion, so my financial situation has been slightly tumultuous over the past 18 months. I am fortunate enough to have savings to fall back on, and currently I am working and able to continue saving, but I'm definitely not financially where I was hoping I would be by the time I turned 30. I am also currently attempting to finish my bachelor's degree. I never attended university while I was young, so I figured if COVID meant that I couldn't work at times, taking online classes could at least give me something to work towards during lockdown periods. I have been fortunate enough that I have been the recipient of grants and scholarships, so schooling has not cost me much, but it does monopolize my time, and when I have classes to attend, I am no longer able to work full time hours at the restaurant.

My BF and I have discussed marriage and engagement many times in the past. He likes to joke about not enjoying the idea of it, but anytime that I ask him seriously, he always says that it does have a place in our future. For the first few years of our relationship, I would always say that I wanted to at least be engaged by the time I'm 30. I know that may seem vain and silly to some people- but we started dating when I was 22, I always kind of assumed that it would be a more than appropriate timeframe. When we were within a year of my 30th birthday, the topic came up in conversation, and his words were somewhere along the lines of: ""It's not going to be before your 30th birthday. COVID threw a wrench in things, but it will happen soon."" I was obviously slightly disappointment, but it wasn't worth causing any sort of argument over. It sounded like he had some type of plan in mind. We love to travel, and COVID meant that we weren't able to travel much around that time, so I assumed that he was just waiting for our next trip (which would make sense as to why COVID was the problem)

Two weeks ago, we went on vacation for the first time since COVID. I found out on the 2nd day of an 8 day trip that not only was he not planning to propose, but that now, he had a new goal that he wanted to reach before proposing. He has a specific amount of money that he wants to have made before we get engaged. I'm not sure if he means between investments, savings, or a specific bank account- I have no idea the specifics, but from what I gathered from our brief conversation on the topic: Goal Number 1- His Net Worth. Goal Number 2- Our Future.

I saw red. We were at a restaurant when he said this to me. To be honest, I'm not even sure if he meant to say it, or if maybe the alcohol had gotten to his head and he let it slip out accidentally. I repeated the number that he said- and I was drunk, and outraged, so I spoke loudly. And he got embarrassed and shushed me. I don't remember exactly what I said to him in the moment- I'm not sure if it was because I was drunk or angry or sad, but I remember crying, and saying something about how much it hurt my feelings. At first he started to say something along the lines of ""I'm allowed to have goals outside of us"" but once he truly realized how upset I was, he stopped making any sort of big deal about it, and he said that he just wanted to enjoy the rest of the night, and to not let this ruin it.

I took that to heart. For the rest of the trip, and for the week since we've been home, I have not brought it up again. But it's been the only thing that I've been thinking about. I've cried so much these past 2 weeks that I can't even count how many times while we were on our trip I had to lie about sniffling and just say that my allergies were acting up. I've cried at work, I've cried lying in bed next to him after he's fallen asleep, I've cried in the shower. I honestly don't know what to think. I can understand having specific goals that you want to achieve before committing to someone. But I don't really understand why it matters how much money he has right before an engagement, as a wedding and ring will very quickly change that number anyways? Unless these are things that he has already calculated into the formula? I don't know- I'm so confused.

Also, I don't understand why the goal needs to come before an engagement? Once we're engaged, it's not like we are now one person and everything he achieves now becomes my achievement too. His money goal will still be his, when I get my degree it will still be mine- but we're just more of a team, tied closer together, happy for one another and our respective goals being achieved, right? Idk, I've never been married or engaged before, maybe it doesn't change much- but I'd like to think that being tied together like that makes your bond stronger, makes you root for each other harder, makes the team feel more connected overall. I don't want to marry him because I want his money- we've openly spoken about signing prenups when the time comes, and I (as the poor one) am all for it! I don't want his money, I want us both to work towards our own success, and to hopefully both succeed as individuals, so that we can kick ass together!

I want to talk to him about this, but I don't know where to begin. I've been trying to organize my thoughts for weeks and I feel like every time I write my thoughts out, I have more and more to say. I've looked into moving out, even if just for a few weeks to clear my head. Unfortunately though, our area currently has very high rent prices and limited rental opportunities, so I don't think I can really opt for this until I have a firmer grasp on whether I know with any certainty that I am going to leave for good. It feels really drastic to even say that, but I also don't know how I'm supposed to keep cohabitating with someone who is putting his bank account before our commitment to one another. He bought groceries the other day, and all I could think about was that now I'm that much further away from my future because he bought food for us! I should also mention- we are not in any sort of financial dire straights. Neither of us has any debt to speak of. The number that he said isn't a reasonable number that you would expect one to have as a sort of nest egg before paying for a wedding- it's a very large number, and the fact that he's close to it, but still feels the need to surpass it before committing to me, it really hurts me, a lot.

I know that not everybody is the marriage type. Some people are okay with just being with one another. And honestly, right now, I wish I was one of those people. I've always known that he's been less inclined to the idea of marriage than I am, but I think that deep down, he loves me, and has said that we will get married because he knows that it's something that I need in my future. I just wish that if he wanted to change the parameters of our future and it's timeline, that he would have at least discussed this goal with me ahead of time. If this were a conversation, instead of a line drawn in the sand, maybe I could have had more of a back and forth, and made a bit more sense of things, but right now, I just feel so lost. I don't know what I want to do or where to go from here. I feel like I need some time and space to really think about what I want from our future, and if I can see myself being with someone who can so callously put money before us. Am I crazy? Am I making way to big of a deal of this? I don't even know. My opinion changes constantly. We've had some great moments together since the initial conversation took place, and I'll think ""Fuck, this guy is awesome, I'm being dramatic, when it happens it happens!"" And then 20 minutes later he goes online to check the stock market and I run to the bathroom before he sees me cry.

So, how do I best proceed? I know I need to talk to him, but how do I bring it up? I want to be civil and as calm as possible, but I'm sure that it will make me emotional to talk about. I'm afraid that once I bring it up, there's a potential for this to be the end of an amazing relationship. I don't want to end it, but I also don't want to be in a competition with his bank account. If anyone has any guidance, or has been through anything similar and had it work out, I am open to suggestions.

TLDR: My boyfriend and I have always agreed that we would get engaged before I turned 30. He didn't propose within that time, said that he would ""soon, but COVID threw a wrench in things"" and then later admitted that before he proposes, he wants to have a specific large sum of money saved, and then our engagement will happen after that.",0

Mostly it helps us feel less alone in dealing with this.  This is r/ at it's best.  But the mods deleted the post while I was in the middle of typing a comment sharing our story in reply to a parent with kids the same age dealing with the same thing. 

Mods, did you really have to lock it in the middle of a discussion that was clearly very meaningful to many of us?   If you're that concerned about your legal liability for medical advice, please just post a warning at the top that says this is discussion forum and seek medical advice from doctors, etc etc.  

Please, we need a place to talk about what's going on in our lives during this very scary time for many of us.  We're all adults, we understand that internet forums shouldn't be trusted for medical advice, that's what doctors are for.

I have never been in love or in a serious relationship until her, but have been with many females and have been in relationships. Throughout our relationship I would like photos of other girls and message the occasional old friend. I never touched another girl at all throughout our relationship. She found out about liking pictures on Instagram and messaging other girls, she hated it and I stopped. Then she started hanging out with her friend and her two guy friends way more often. Never thought much about it. Her affection sort of declined for me and I started messaging girls who were my friends not really having intentions of anything like cheating. Anyways she continues to hangout with these guys and it starts upsetting me but I don’t say anything about it, I start messaging one girl and she finds out again. She ends up wanting a break so we broke up and everything sucked for the first month feeling heartbroken then shit turned around for a month and then I see she is now with the guy she was hanging out with. I finally go to her house and get my jacket from her and it ends up with us laying under the stars holding eachother and being the happiest we’ve been since the breakup, we kissed and everything felt so good.

1390,"Toddler terrified of her room HELP.       







      









My almost 2-year-old daughter is terrified of her room. 6 days ago we had an electrician working in our backyard, and he had to drill in the wall right hear my daughter's window RIGHT as she was falling asleep for her nap.       






      






(I had no idea he would need to drill there, otherwise I would have waited to put her down!!!).     






      







Bedtime has gotten a bit better, because her 4-year-old sister shares the room with her at night and helps her by flipping through books until she's calm enough to sleep.           









      







Nap time is a disaster. The most success I've had is letting her fall asleep on top of me, usually in the rocking chair, but I have not had any luck transferring her to her bed. This is not sustainable because she often takes extremely long naps (sometimes over 3 hours).      






      








I am currently sitting in her room with her while she falls asleep. It took an hour of calming and soothing to get her to be okay in the bed without me holding her. I cannot do this every day. I have tried forcing her to stay in her room while she cries frantically and it just feels awful. My husband was home the other day and he tried letting her cry herself to sleep. It took 30 minutes and I'm pretty sure it made my soul break. I'm also not sure if it made the situation worse.

Doesn't use make up really, not any big jewelry either. Likes to dress casually but looks astounding in all clothes, maybe just me haha.

I was thinking i could get Small necklace, like Blue heart necklace since I use blue hearts with her since its her favorite color. Not big but small, so she could use it casually too.

1238,"Aggressive &amp; passive-aggressive behavior from neighbor. We want to enjoy our yard :(  

We  do not want to move. 

Everything about this house fits our needs with a  low maintenance flat backyard and interior that met everything we  wanted. Financially it is difficult to move and there is no guarantee we  will have any better neighbors.

We've kept minimal professional communication (minimal relatioship) with our neighbor based on our previous experiences but we have a difficult neighbor. Examples:

1. Knocked on our door the first day we came in and asked to come inside our house. (aggressive)
2. His  wife knocked on our door with the guise of offering pizza at 10 P.M. on  a Saturday night. We were already asleep because we work early mornings  and weekends. (passive aggressive)
3. They  post a lot of complaints on the neighborhood social media group and  randomly share stories of how they did not get a long with the previous  neighbors that lived in our house and how they went to the police  frequently to report their behavior. We view it but we choose not to  post or engage since we learned it does us no good in the long  run.(passive aggressive &amp; aggressive)
4. Gifted us their wheel barrow with the guise to keep our yard clean. (passive aggressive)
5. Every  time we are out in the yard even just keeping low level conversations  in our small private canopy, the neighbors spend ten minutes out their  yard opening and shutting their garbage cans very loudly. (passive  aggressive). we thought it coincidental but we documented 20 instances  so it is no longer coincidental.(passive aggressive)
6. They told us in previous passing that they have weekly coffee with the neighborhood sheriff.

I  do not know if their intention is to provoke us to move or encouraging  that they want silent and minimal activity and movement in our yard. Regardless their behavior has been difficult and uncomfortable.

It  is odd and we think deep down they are very sad people with little  outlet, but I digress.

We have two very young children, one with ADHD who needs to get his energy out as we have a small house inside. when the kids go out they play quietly and do not even yell. 

We  have an HOA who I inquired about noise level who indicated we should be  able to ""enjoy playing with our kids in a peaceful manner"" and ""as long  as it does not disrupt the hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.""

We  do not want to move. Everything about this house fits our needs with a  low maintainance flat backyard and interior that met everything we  wanted. Financially it is difficult to move and there is no guarantee we  will have any better neighbors.

Is our best option to just ignore this neighbor and try to enjoy our yard?

3137,"What went wrong? Im so hurt 
22F here. So there’s this girl ( around my age) who is a  family friend who has been living with us for a month and a half. •She’s here bc she’s new to the city and still looking for an appartement. We got along pretty well we talk,spend time together etc. Im currently pretty sick so she would always check on me, every morning, make sure i ate, ask me if im okay etc. She’s amazing, she’s funny, she’s very kind and thoughtful. She’s the best. Things took a turn last weekend.

•We had a very long and intimate conversation on Saturday morning and spent the whole day together . From that day and the 2 days that followed we were stuck together like glue. I started sleeping in her bed with her or her in mine, we became extremely touchy with other, flirt ALL the time, cuddle all night, talk, watch movies, hold hands, hug every minutes.Everytime,  she left me for 5-10 minutes she came back with a smile and said “ did you miss me?” , “ You ok? I know you can’t live without me”. She would  touch  my face, run her fingers through my hair, hold my hand, caress my skin, ask me to lay on her chest etc.

•I didn’t know if she did all that romantically or as friends, but i didn’t mind one or the other bc i myself don’t know  if it was either of those for me. I was just living in the moment. So the 4th day, everything stopped completely. She stopped smiling at me, flirting, hugging me , she became very distant. I thought well maybe its just today. But we’re now on day 6 and she’s still very distant and cold. We stopped sleeping in the same bed.We went from not being able to not touch each other to 0 physical contact at all. I tried talking to her she responded without much interest. She still says hello and stuff like that but its not the same anymore. Its really hurting me. I even wish things were the way they were before those 3 days bc at least she talked to me more and smiled to me. I taught maybe it was bc school started this week and she was stressed out, but her behaviour hasn’t changed with anyone else in the house but me. She laughs with everyone, hugs everyone but me. 

   Im over here rn trying to figure out what i possibly did wrong. Maybe i was too touchy? Maybe i went too far? Maybe she felt overwhelmed? I always made sure to respect her boundaries and asked her to tell me if i ever made her uncomfortable. So i don’t get it. Im confused. I know that bc im sick im a lot more emotionally fragile rn, but am i being dramatic? What could possibly explain her behaviour?

He started eating more on Wednesday and was back to his normal self yesterday. The only evidence is the rash.

Daughter developed redness around the area and developed some anxiety.

The non-children ER was not equipped to exam the daughter. They did helped with doing a Child Protection Service reporting on the school. 

 A forensic/criminal full examination of my daughter couldn't be used against the other five year old.

1783,"BF snapped and said ""If I'm so bad, leave me"" and I did......having 2nd thoughts. He is GONE NOW My BF of 10 months is long distance.  Because I was self employed I would go to him 2 weeks or at least 1.5 weeks a months.  He owns his own business and said he couldn't lose his momentum.  For all this time...I understand. I traveled to him and 85 percent of the time ...I paid for everything.  Albiet when I would go there he paid for all dinners etc.  But trips would cost about 1k for me....  with travel, parking...dog sitting etc.  

He was strong when he said he hates the climate where I live and he couldn't visit there much until winter.  I have been to him 20 times...he's been to me 4 times.  

This past trip he told me he couldn't come to me because he had an office meeting last Monday.  So I sucked int up and paid...traveled...etc and got there to realize he had NOTHING on Monday.   and he was literally pissed at me because I was working too much on that day.

I felt so betrayed again.  I didn't say anything but I felt I wasn't attracted to him and literally it impacted my sex desire.  I was mad.

I went through everything but he noted that I wasn't as sweet and as attentive to him...aka I didn't give him blow jobs.  I said well I'm preoccupied.

Today he asked me to come back for Labor Day weekend and asked the times. He actually offered to pay for this one.....and I finally told him the truth.  I said I was very upset that he clearly lied to me to get ME to go to him and I listed off another thin.  He said ""if I'm so bad you we shouldn't be together..."" 

He said I was non stop drama since I also told him it bothered me that I felt he cut me off in my communication.  He said he felt that since I was hating on him so much...and clearly despised him....he needs time to think and he needs time apart with me.

I said WOW so I told you how I feel ...I kindly told you that this stuff was bothering me ...and yes, I felt you lied to me...  You LEAVE ME? 

He said that he no longer has faith in our relationship because I clearly show that despise him.

I'm SO confused.  He says we need a break.   WTH/. How do I cope?",0
2491,"I (27M) got rejected, but she(27F) keeps inviting me to stuff and trying to hold my attention A year ago I met a women (our mutual friend introduced us), was really into her but it wasn't mutual. I was upset but I pretty much got over it. She kept on staying in touch with me. I kept it brief but we would still talk once or twice a week. I was trying to have some distance so that I could get over it. I think she realized this and started hitting me up to do stuff. Sometimes it would be just us, sometimes with our friends. When hanging out I would get mixed signals. She would clearly check me out and give me the look down, but then when she was with her friends, she would ""name drop"" the dude she was been seeing. At first I didn't really care, but over time it has started to bother me. I slowed down our communication even more as I was tired of feeling emasculated. I never initiate our conversations anymore.  

  
She is currently seeing some guy, but they aren't ""official"". Seems like she is pretty unsure about what she wants. A friend mentioned how she brought me up when she was drunk one night and tried to get one of my friends to see if I liked her. She just recently invited me to a get together with all of our friends and this new dude. I haven't responded.   


I really liked her a lot( like I had dreams about her and what not) and its pretty confusing. I spoke with a friend about it and he said it sounds like she wants to keep me around for future possibilities while she lives out her late 20s. Its either that or she   


Im not willing to be someone's back up plan. Really looking for true love.

1215,"Daughter's new nursery sucks My 3YO daughter has been going to the same nursery since she was 8 months old, and she loved it.  She loved the teachers, she loved all the books and reading, she loved everything about it.  Unfortunately the nursery was only up until 3 years old, so we had to transfer to a new nursery this year.

This new nursery is complete garbage, and I don't know what to do about it.

I went to the principal today and asked her about my ""concerns,"" and here is her response to each one.

1. **They don't have picture books.**  She said that kids 2 to 3 years old can't read picture books yet, and there are too many students for each teacher to read books 1 on 1.  So the kids can't just flip through the books?  There is no time when the teacher reads to everyone?
2. **They don't have singing or dancing**. She said that sometimes they play music in the 'hall,' a small gymnasium, which is where they go because...
3. **They don't play outside.** She said this is because it's too hot, which I guess I understand, but they haven't gone out to play even on days when the weather is very mild so...?

I just don't know what to do.  It's been about a month, and my kid still fights leaving the house, and then cries when we get there.  My kid loved, LOVED going to her old nursery.  At home she would sing songs she learned, talked about the book truck which came to the nursery so kids could pick out books to look at, and talked about playing with kids outside.

This is just so messed up, I don't know what to do.  Transferring to a new nursery is going to be near impossible at least until March.  I guess just let my kid suffer until then?",1

3042,"My BF feels anxiety thinking about moving in with me Secondary account, not an English native speaker, etc.

My boyfriend (30M), let's call him Peter, and I (27F) have been in a relationship for 3 years. We have not been rushing things, although one year into the relationship we were already thinking about renting an apartment together, but because of me losing financial stability, we couldn't do it. We have been bringing back this topic about moving in together once in a while and we both always talked about it as the next natural step.

Last year, Peter started to feel anxious and sad. There were bad news in his family, he lost some friends, etc. I won't go into details, but the fact is he became a little moody and irritable. He never stopped talking about living together and never stopped saying “I love you” and that stuff, so I don't think his feelings for me have changed, but I can't say for sure. For example, he mentioned about having kids and I, who thought I wouldn't have kids ever, am starting to think it wouldn't be a bad idea.

However, now that I have a better financial situation, he told me that he feels so anxious about moving in with me, that he doesn't want to lose me if it doesn't work and he doesn't want to worry me, but he doesn't feel as much excited as anxious. He said as well that he stills wants to live with me, but he wanted to share his concerns.

What should I do? Now I feel a little numb and I can't think clearly. Do you think he doesn't love me anymore? Did any of you with anxiety felt this way when moving in with your SO?",0
1424,"I know this relationship with a son is not normal, but does it have a name? So to start off, I need to give information on the said mother. She moved to a different country when she was around 28 with her husband, gave birth to three children there, and her husband died when she was around 32 I guess. The marriage was short-lived, and she was left alone in a country she didn’t knew the language of with no direct familial support, but she had a wide circle of families from her home country, so they had almost a family-like relationship with each other. She lacked a husband and direct family aside from her daughters and a son.

The husband died when the son was around one. So he never got to meet her.

The mother, as she tells it now, paid more attention to son and allowed him to do things she wouldn’t let her daughters to do because he had never known his father, and she tolerated his acts.

Now, the sun is an addict, constantly in and out of jail, and the mother’s love for him is... disgustingly unending.

She approves of everything she does to the point that she asks for money from her grandchildren to give to his son, so that he can buy cigarettes or anything that he buys. She sold all her belongings to pay his debts. He got stabbed, he got involved with the mafia, and she is still like “He grew up without a father. That’s okay, and she’s also a man so they do such things.”

She openly discriminates his son from her daughters to the point of dismissing them, and she has a deep hatred for women in general and wants everyone to submit to men, always insults women wherever she is and praises the way men are. He has disrespected her countless times, he has disrespexted us countless times, but while she is very spiteful to everyone, she doesn’t even get mad at him and welcomes him with warm arms whenever she comes back from trespassing, addiction or general stabbing things.

I can’t quite tell you the love she has, because it’s disgusting and makes me wanna puke, but it is so all consuming and it seriously plays with our minds. She is openly discriminative against my family too, she treats her son’s family like they are angels that descended from heaven. While she curses around us, doesn’t speak to us — she is so talkative, funny and happy around them that I can’t take it. For a long time I knew she had a mental illness, and she is diagnosed with it too, but this toxic love for her son is so... unexplainably irritates something in my brain. It’s literally like as if she sees her son as a perfect being, as a man allowed to do everything, as a person who can never do wrong. His son is a terrible person, but she keeps cursing to his wife, and she is so hateful towards her that it is literally the best display of how bad her love is.

I descripted all of these things, but to grasp the full concept, you literally need to see her. Even if the son kills a man, she would say he was right and men are allowed to do such things. The longest time he had a job was for around six months, and he is a full grown man aged mid fourties with multiple kids. He literally can’t speak clearly from all the smoking, drinking and addictions. He doesn’t care about his mom, because now she is in need of a caregivers and he literally leaves her to die. But still, she curses at us, and wants her son by her side.

Does this have a name? I feel like this is some kind of a *ucked up incestous thing, because literally, she loves him more than she loves herself, and even though he’s a grown ass man, she sees him as an angelic boy with no wrongs. I hate it. Even as a teenager the son was an addict and she accepted it as a “he grew up without a father and men are allowed to do such things” thing.

Also, please don’t be this way. You’remnot only ruining your child’s life, but you ruin yours and the coming generations’ lives too. Me, literally a person who shares so little of blood with him suffer from his actions and I can’t say I fully love the mother without a single drop of hate.",1

2477,"Girlfriend (22F) convinced herself that I (23M) gave her a ultimatum back in March, I'm at my wits end with her. We have been together since December 2020. I haven't met her family due to her Mother being paranoid of getting CoVid.

Back in March 2 major things had happened. She had a friend who died and she was in grief that week  (This will matter later)and we had a discussion that really put me off. She is Muslim and I'm Christian. From what she has told me I need her family's approval for marriage, from her Brother specifically. When I was told this information by her I asked her:

Me: So if your brother does not approve of me you would just break it off with me there?

Her: I mean yeah, what's the issue?

Me: So if your family just straight up does not approve of me because just simply just don't like me you would just end it with me?

Her: Honestly yes because I only have my mother and brothers and my family is extremely important to me.

At that point I felt like I was just waiting around to just be told no. The reason I had an issue with this is because:

1. She was basically letting her brother dictate her marriage and happiness.
2. Her Mother has expressed what kind of ideal man she would like for her, I don't fit that description.
3. I told her that our relationship should never have a 3rd party involved and that's exactly what is going to happen.

I had went home after that and by next day she was saying sorry and basically telling me that even if they said no that she would fight for me and she doesn't want this to end on a bad note. We talked it out and stayed together.

Fast forward to late August, we going through a rough patch right now. She and one of her brothers are staying at their friends Mothers house kind of to keep her company for the week. I get off of work and she says she wanted to call about something. Alright cool that's fine. She was basically asking me about how I was about to leave her back in March over her choosing her family over me. She then tells me how I always express that I love my sister to death which is true, and proceeds to ask me if I would choose my sister over her if my sister did not approve of her. I replied with:

""No I would not, because my Sister or even my Mom do not dictate who I should and should not be with. If they had brought up how they don't like you? Ok cool, they can feel that way, If they had pointed out red flags like how you had no ambition or were just disrespect for example then I would take that with consideration. Ultimately it would be up to me, but all they have are opinions just like any outside party should.""

She then tries to say that I would putting a lot of pressure on her because it happened to be the same week her friend died, basically victimizing herself into thinking I was wrong to bring that topic up on the week her friend died. I didn't confront her on this because she would of made it into something it never will be.

She then tells me that I have a lot of family and that she only has her Mothers and Brothers so it is easy for me to cut off family like it nothing. While I do have a lot of family, I don't speak or reach out to a big majority of them so that was not really a good excuse for her.

Lastly the part that pisses me off the most is that **I initially told her that I did not come here to separate her away from her family.** She says that is what is feels like because of how our conversation went in March. And when I tell her that no person would be comfortable being in that position no matter how you try to justify it. And now I'm on the verge of just breaking this all off.

The problem is she is letting people who contribute to her misery dictate her happiness. And to be fair she can be a pushover when it comes to her family from the way she vents to me about them.

Can I please get some thoughts and advice on all of this? I know its a bit scattered and sorry for that. I am just very, very annoyed right now.",0
883,"Other Parents Opinions Ok this is a parent related AITA situation. I am the only Parent around in my group of friends, so I would love to hear what others think. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, AITA if I send my 5 year old daughter to school, masked, if she has the sniffles during Covid?

NOT Seeking medical advice or anything like that, just want what you would think if you found out a parent was doing this in your kid's class. Also wait for context before immediately passing judgement. 

I live in the US, in a state where schools are prevented from mandating masks, but our numbers are relatively low. So we are not exploding like Texas or Florida.  

She just started Kindergarten and everyday she wears a mask to school. She is also very trained in washing her hands frequently (we recently moved FROM Florida at the beginning of the spring, and her Daycare was very very vigilant about it). We've talk to her about Covid, explained to her the importance of keeping yourself clean and masked so to help keep others healthy etc. She understands, at least enough to follow our directions with no issues. 

Now background, she has had, since birth, medical issues, that mostly present with Sinus/Runny Nose stuff. I can pretty much count on my hands the number of months in her 5 years she HASNT had a constant runny nose. She has had surgeries, booster shots for certain vaccines (strep and oh I forget the other one... but it's to do again with  breathing and nose stuff), and allergy tests. All of it pretty much culminates to, She's allergic to a bunch of stuff, and she will be plagued with runny noses quite often in life. She pretty much gets one every time we switch to a new environment (when she goes to her Grandmas, or goes to a different school, meets a different group of kids etc)

So Friday, she comes home from school with a bit of a sniffle. Because of these times, I check her temp, and keep an eye on her. Through the weekend, sniffles persist, but she is still super high energy, no fever, no cough, no breathing issues (she's asthmatic as well, so when we ask her about it, she knows what it feels like to have breathing trouble and how to communicate it) her sense of taste is fine, as is her tummy. So pretty much, no other symptom of Covid but a runny nose. Come Monday, I start checking her temp before school, after school, and before bed. No fever. 

We also have not gone anywhere since school started, and the only people we saw right before school started were family, who do not have any covid symptoms (They are vaccinated, as are me and her dad) 

So me, knowing her history, following numbers in her school (the state website says there is a case, but its not in her class) and watching as her sniffles just kinda... not get worse, and start to get better, I send her to school. I remind her to mask and wash her hands, and keep an eye on things. 

However, some parents on another site heard me say that and are now are down my throat, saying I am the AH because I am not keeping her home. I am trying to be vigilant and respectful of the times, but I am also trying not to over react and let my daughter miss out on education (since we dont have a virtual school option) by keeping her home unnecessarily when my gut is telling me it's just simple cold, that she gets often.  

So what would you think? If this was someone in your child's class? Would you be upset? I mean, is it expectation that I dont know (she's my Only and I didnt grow up around kids) that kids are to be kept home no matter what? I always kinda followed the rule of Fever, Tummy Issues or Rashes.",1

My son walked about 2/3 of the time and I insisted on most of the time in the stroller because I knew we would be walking a bit further. My daughter was in the stroller about 90% of the time. 

She often complains about being tired when going for a walk, even to the park behind our house. She often wants to be carried and I am becoming a bit worried.

Then we moved over to Facebook and just messaged through there. Throughout the years he would reach out to me and we would speak as friends but then we stopped messaging for 6 years. He wrote me last year for the first time in 6 years, which I think because COVID happened. He checked on me and see how I was doing. 

I recently reached out to him last week for the first time ever. It’s been over a year since we talked, but I asked him how he was doing. We chatted briefly as he lives way across the world. Time is not on our side, he’s like 7 or 8 hours ahead. So, I got to thinking of how we started talking to each other and I kinda miss the sexting with him. Even though we haven’t talked to each other in that way in over 10 years. We have kept it friendly. I kinda threw a hint that last time we talked and said “i think about you sometimes” but he didn’t really responded to it. Maybe he has girlfriend, but he’s never mentioned seeing anyone. Or he just don’t gaf that I said that, which is fine too. He doesn’t have to think of me. 

My question is, should I approach him about wanting to sext again or just keep our conversation as friends? 

I’m not seeking a relationship with him either.",0
206,"My dream is to be a mother. I am a transwoman. Can I be a real role model for my daughter? My dream is to be a mother. I am a transsexual woman. I want to adopt children in the future. Can a transgender woman become a real mother in the family and a feminine role model for my daughter in your opinion? How? What do you recommend?  
The family and children play an important role in my upbringing. That is why it was not easy to accept myself as a woman. I had to change my perspective about these things: I can have a family and children if I accept the role of a wife and mother. This new thought helped me to came out as a woman.   
I would like to be a real mother of my future children. I want to talk about my past when they will be adults. According my doctors I have a huge chance to be a fully passable woman. So probably they will not notice anything. Moreover, I will undergo gender reassignment surgery before their adoption. So my daughter will not see a strange, not feminine body.   
I only started my transition at the age of 33. I didn’t grow up like a girl and most of my life spent as a guy. In spite of this, how can I be a good mother and a feminine role model for my daughter?",1
1889,"Don’t know if i should stay or go?! Me (25f) and my boyfriend (38m) have been together for 3 years. We have two little ones together. In May of this year things started to get super bad. Like pretty much fighting every day and every weekend he had his kids from his previous marriage (the kids were rude to me and always misbehaved and he never says anything to them). Our fights got so bad, he would block my number, avoid coming home, or stay at his ex brother in laws for days (yes he was really there) this happened through June and July. I decided to call it quits after he didn’t want to go to couples counseling. However we still had to interact because in July i was still pregnant. He was there with me at the hospital and that brought us closer together for like two weeks then out of nowhere he started acting like an asshole to me again (the day before we had our son he told me i was nothing like the girl he met, he wished he never met me, I’m a glorified babysitter, called me a leech, and whole lot of other hurtful things. I try to not think about everything he said because this man really tried to crush my soul that night). I went through his phone and found out he’d been talking to some chick in another state that he met through IG. I told him i couldn’t believe this was why he didn’t want to go to couples counseling. Then he tried to tell me this girl meant nothing and that he still loved me. I told him to fuck off and he left to brother in laws for 3 days. He came back and told me he broke it off with said girl and told her he still loved me. He agreed to do couples counseling with me and our pastor also suggested individual counseling and he blocked this girl after i asked him too.For the whole month of august we have been very loving and intimate, he told me he wants to be a happy family and get married. However he asked me to move out while we do individual counseling because the counselor suggested it for the specific type of therapy he’s going to be doing. I agreed to it however. I’ve had to pack up my two kids and my life and live in a small bedroom with my two kids at my dads apartment. And since I’ve left all the happiness i felt towards him has gone away. I feel angry and resentful that he made me pack up and leave when he could have stayed at his brother in laws and let me stay at our apartment with the kids. They’re both under the age of 2. So it’s very overwhelming. I have to readjust my whole way of living and theirs too! I just needed to vent mostly. But feel free to give advice.",0
2109,I am losing it. The one thing I wanted more then anything sits in another room and I just can't take anore of this. She has been blasting me in this subreddit for months now and most of it I have kept quiet. She talks down to me as if she is better than me. Wants me to open up to her which I have tried I can't say anything and she starts to try and over talk me to tell me I am wrong. Sure I messed up to get us here I own that. But she is for damn  sure not innocent not by a long shot she is just better at hiding it. When I catch her she just blocks me from being able to see it. Then I try to tell her how I feel it better not have a shred of a  hint of an accusation or like she has done repeatedly she will leave she (but not actually leave) this last time she did I went across the state to follow her because she asked me to only to have her leave me again so I left and went home. So guess where she is? Yep still in my home still kinda broken up still kinda not. It's not fair that she is toying with my emotions like this and I am pretty sure it's Intentional and she just enjoys hurting me. But I can't get rid of her. I have been locked in my room for weeks now. And she tells me I am the problem. She supposedly came here to work on us amd.give her son a place to stay. Cool kids safe but she is tormenting me to the point I am about to snap and I don't want that. I am lost and I am breaking,0
1599,"Our best friend lashed out on us, blocked us, basically broke up with us and we don’t even know why yet. There’s this dude that my boyfriend and I made friends with almost exactly a year ago. We met him through another mutual friend of ours and then out of nowhere, all 4 of us were doing psychedelics together for every single holiday until Jan 2021. Then, we did the same thing, but with minor holidays, then it was just every single weekend but without psychedelics all the time.

We grew so close in such a short amount of time. I gifted him his love for philosophy, and he gifted me my love for film. Eventually, we found out that him and I were actually related and we were cousins. It was a crazy story.

He loved us and we loved him. He, like many of us, has gone through terrible things he shouldn’t have gone through. And like many of us, he carried his burdens everywhere he went. But we didn’t care. He was our buddy, and we were his. He is such an amazing person. He deserves to be loved, and we really thought we were giving that to him. We loved watching movies together and playing poker and playing Apex and having conversations that would last for hours and hours on end.

He hated himself because of a lot of things but one of the main reasons was because he was a hardcore alcoholic and he had little experience with self-love and self-care. So I taught him skin care and I pushed him to use our expensive hygiene products and to drink the good water instead of the tap that he would always serve himself. I listened to all his random rants with lots of love and we made him his favorite breakfast every weekend. We gave him flowers, a bookshelf, as well as a framed custom-made list of his top 10 favorite films of all time for his birthday because he is the best bud ever and we loved him so much we just thought he deserved flowers and all these other nice things. And even though my boyfriend and I are barely making it, we bought him many gifts that came straight from the bottom of our heart. None of those gifts compared to the peace that he would bring to us. It was inexplicable, incomparable.

The last week we got to spend with him, he said: “I’ve never hosted anything, and I’ve never been one to take people to my home to meet my family, but if you’ll come, I’ll host a get together at my house with my family so they can see the amazing people I’ve now got in my life”

The day we were set to hang out, we tried calling him, and we realized that he had blocked us. The change was so sudden and so unnatural of him. So unexpected from our relationship, which was founded on acceptance, love, LOTS of communication, and support.

We were extremely concerned because based on our observations, on things he has told us about himself, and on recent events in his life, we honestly thought something had happened to him. So out of fear and concern, we went to his house.

When we answered the door, he lashed out on us. He called us stalkers (even though we had gone to his house many times to drop him off and he’s invited us over many times). He threatened to call the police on us (knowing full well we were carrying weed with us). He said we should know what we did and he really thought we were his friends. When we asked him what was wrong and why he was hurt, he kicked us out again and limited himself to say that when he feels like talking to us, he will. Then we left. Shocked out of our minds.

My boyfriend and I had NO idea what in the world we could have possibly done. We literally had hung out two days prior and everything was beyond fine.

It’s been months now since we spoke to him. He doesn’t answer our calls (we’ve called him about 3-4 times in all these months and I sent him one paragraph).

The last we heard of him was what he had said to our mutual friend when he asked him why he hates us now. According to our mutual friend, he said: “I can’t tell you why I stopped talking to them or what they did, because if I did, you’d think they’re horrible people”.

As soon as we heard that, we raged to each other about his words. I mean how dare he? We cared for him so much and we supported him and helped him see his true value as a wonderful human being. We welcomed him into very private parts of our life, and he did too. We helped him get through some nasty shit with his family and friends. We loved him. We showed him that he is loved. How dare he… how dare he shit on us like this? My boyfriend and I have had endless conversations on what we could’ve possibly done to him. We went back to our messages, we thought about our recent calls, we asked around, we have no idea what in the hell we did. The worst part is that he didn’t even give us the courtesy of a conversation, a heads up, or even a bit of decency in the way he pushed us away. I mean kicking us out of his house like that? Threatening to call the cops even though we literally had been standing on his doorway for less than 20 seconds before he said that?

How dare he speak like that about us… we gave him our trust and our love and it just hurts so much.

I have no idea how to deal with this loss. My boyfriend is trying to play it off and pretends not to care, but I know he hurts just as much as I do. I’ve seen him cry over it.

We remember him often, and we’re working hard to give him the space he needs. But to be honest with you all, the most painful part of this, and the only thing that makes this unbearable is the cruel way in which he trashed us and the things he said about us to other people.

The truth is that I miss him so much it hurts. I’m glad I have my boyfriend because without him I straight up wouldn’t be able to make it. But knowing that our friend hates us like this and is willing to treat us like this… so callus, so cold, so insensitive. I cry about it often. I know I did my best to make him feel loved and accepted by us, so I have no regrets. I just can’t seem to get past it.

I know there’s nothing else to do other than move on and live my life as is without him and accept the possibility that he may never talk to us again, but it’s more complicated than that simply because like I said earlier, that’s not the most painful part. The worst part is having to remember him as someone who made us feel like a pathetic pair of low-life assholes who don’t deserve a simple conversation.

I just want someone to say something that might help me feel better. Or someone to ask questions or give advice… I just need all the help I can get and I know that my fellow Redditors can be really helpful, resourceful, and really fucking amazing sometimes.

Thank you for your time.",0
3168,"My bf (M25) of 5 years made a tinder account which I found on his phone. Hi there, this is a long one.

Thank you for taking the time to read my poorly strung together words.

I’m (F28)

I found tinder on his phone and saw he had made an account with one photo of him and his two friends wearing masks as the photo was taken during covid. It had details of his name, age, job title, and no bio. He had not matched with anyone. (It was on there for almost a month.)

I confronted him about it and he said he went on it once and regretted doing it and he thought he had deleted the app. Well actually he first said it must of accidentally installed, but I knew that was not true. I don’t have Tinder and don’t know how it works, but I’m not an idiot.

I wanted to know why he did it. He said that he was on Reddit on a tinder page with funny bios and wanted to go on it because he wanted to see more funny bios and women as he was lonely and bored of going on YouTube, Reddit, and pornhub. 

He also said being in lockdown has caused him to feel very lonely when we are not together (we don’t live together) as he has no one to talk too.

These are poor excuses and I know this is not the real reason why.

I’ve made it clear that he can be open with me and if he wants our relationship to survive he must tell me the truth and come to me when he is not happy.

He says he wants to still be together and loves me. He wants to work it out, but I still haven’t gotten a good answer why he did it.

I’m shocked that he did this as the relationship was going well and we have been saving to buy a house with each other.

A bit about my bf....

My boyfriend cannot not take criticism and withdraws. Even if the person is just telling him how they feel. He will see it as an attack and deflect or make excuses. He truly believes in those excuses and won’t face it head on.

His parents had a messy divorce when he was young and I believe they did get the kids involved in a unhealthy way. His family can sometimes be too hard on him and quite critical. 

To be honest I can also be too quick to react when he makes me upset or closes off. I always apologize and have been trying to not be like that. I’m very self aware of my own faults and how they hurt him.

He’s had a hard time keeping a job and been in jobs that treated him poorly. He is in a job right now that he currently has gotten a warning for under performing. (He has only been there for 4 weeks.). I’ve always supported him and don’t judge him for this. He just needs to find his place.

I understand he is stressed, has issues with taking criticism and low self esteem. 
 
My heart says stay and try to fix the relationship, but my logical side says it might not be possible for me to trust him again and what if he can’t tell me he wants out.

We are going to meet at a mutual spot on the weekend and talk about things and been slowing opening up to each other on the phone.

How should I approach this and has anyone gone through the same thing with their partner?",0

3196,"The man (29 m) interested in me (23 f) sent me a very suspicious meme and I can't get it out of my head He generally seems like a very nice, sweet and even pretty innocent guy. I liked him a lot, but what he sent me has completely shattered the image I had of him in my head. I don't have the meme saved, but basically it was a guy standing and there was a boulder above him saying ""anxiety and depression"" and the thing keeping it from falling on him said ""underage girls."" I tried wrapping my head around it and try to see if there's anyway that it could be read that isn't noncey, but I couldn't. So I confronted him and asked him to explain. He said that it was just a meme and it wasn't serious, that he had stolen it from someone else and ""would never be interested in minors."" But even if it were supposed to be an eDgY meme, he doesn't seem to be like someone into that kind of humor. For a while I tried to forget about it because he seemed seriously upset about me potentially breaking things off and I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, like I've saved some pretty yikes memes in the past but this is a grown ass man. Shouldn't he know better?  And I can't forget it. I feel so turned off by him when I think about it, like if I ever found out that he is into shit like that I'd want to throw hands with the man myself. I feel disgusted, and it's worse not knowing. Was it just a dumb meme or is he hiding something? How would I even be able to know? I don't think I can. For a while I was really enjoying talking to him and I thought maybe it could become more but then I remembered and now I want nothing to do with him. 

TL;DR: potential bf sent me a meme that made him seem like a nonce but he says it's a joke and I don't know what to think",0
484,"How long does the toddler biting, pinching, phase last? My 3 yr old recently started preschool and had a bad reaction where he is squeezing and biting other kids at school. I know some of this is normal and we are working with him to catch the behavior, set a boundary, and redirect when he tries it with his twin sister at home. But he keeps escalating. Today he pinched and squeezed my arms. I told him no squeezing, squeeze a pillow instead. I've read books about not biting. But no matter what I try, it just seems to be making it worse. Maybe the preschool is a bad fit, or he's just not ready. He told me he does t want to go to school without me and he also told me he doesn't like the school (which is an immersion school) because of the Spanish. But I really really want it to work because I want to get a job and have a life again and stop watching my kids 24/7. I don't want to be on another wait-list for preschool for another 6 months.

1819,"I'm in the perfect relationship but I like someone else (21 F) Hi everyone, this is a throw away account because I don't normally use reddit but I'm very conflicted. 

I am a 21 female and I am dating a 21 male, we have been together for about a year. Nearly every aspect of my relationship is perfect, he's kind, caring, and pays tons of attention to me. He has consistently shown up for me when I most needed it and supports me emotionally in a way that I have not experienced in relationships previously. I recognize I'm young, and this might sound dumb to those out there who are older or with more life experience but I am into someone else. 

There is a 23 male in one of my college courses who is my type to a T. I have no guarantee that there is even anything there but I can not stop thinking about him. He is more conventionally attractive than my current boyfriend and very intelligent. He pays a lot of attention to me and I can't help but think he finds me attractive. I can not figure out if it something about him or there is some aspect of my relationship that I do not feel fulfilled in. However, it I feel like it would be premature to throw away a relationship that I have put in so much time and effort into for feelings that might go away soon. I realize that I have not given a lot of detail and this is mostly because I am unsure what is totally applicable, I do not want to bring this up to anyone in my life for fear that it could somehow get back to my boyfriend because I think it would devastate him. I am trying to be objective but if I find myself attracted to other men so easily, am I really as invested in this relationship as I should be? 

Side note, I go to a STEM college so the ratio is 30:70 for women to men, so I am used to a lot of male attention especially because my major has even less women by ratio than the rest of the school. 

So what should I do?",0

130,"To all the parents of children with “difficult” temperaments I’ve seen a few posts recently from parents who are raising a child with a difficult temperament and I just want you to know that I see you. I am you. It’s hard, it’s really hard. The standard  advice wasn’t made for us. It was made for “easy” babies because, oddly enough, “easy” is the most common temperament. However, us parents who got a “difficult” baby which is far less common (10%), are left floundering because our kids just operate differently. 

I know your kid is awesome and I know you’re doing a great job as a parent even if it doesn’t always feel like it. I know your baby is full of sweet, funny, sensitive moments even if they don’t always act that way. You kid is just as lovable as those easy-babies. 

One thing to remember when you’ve had a long day of tantrums and power struggles and you just can’t help but wish your kid were a little easier: research shows that babies with a difficult temperament have a TON of potential and they are the most responsive to  style. When responded to with empathy and compassion, babies with a difficult temperament tend to be extremely successful later in life. By time they reach school age, it’s not unusual for them to be class leaders and top students. On the contrary, when difficult babies are subjected to authoritarian  styles, they tend to have behavioral issues and end up in trouble later on. Easy babies are awesome too but they are far less impacted by  style and in general, they tend to make up the average. The research is out there, next time you’re wondering if your  even matters with these strong willed kids, look it up! It definitely does. 

All I’m saying is, hang in there. You have a great kiddo with a ton of potential but your job as a parent is going to be a little harder. Just try to keep your eye on the goal: raising good humans.",1
3234,"My (26m) gf (25f) met a bunch of my previous hookups at a bar and she's pissed at me Okay so here's some backstory:

I used to be big on hookups from about 2018-late2019, I've been with close to 60 girls total between tinder and the bars I used to frequent. All of it was 100% clear that it was hookups, had a couple of fwb and tbh I enjoyed it. Out of all of those 14 of them came from the same bar and most of them I hooked up with at least 4 or 5 times on top of just generally being good friends with them, for about 3 months there wasn't a night I wasn't with someone. Eventually I got tired of that and decided to settle down, that's when I started taking things seriously and after a few months met my amazing GF.

Bow for the record, she knows my history, she know I've been with a lot of girls but doesn't know the number, she said she didn't want to know so I knew she was somewhat uncomfortable with it.

Now fast forward to last weekend, we're fully vaccinated and want to go out for a night since we don't get to do that much so she's picks a place and we go. To my shock when we pulled into the parking lot it was my old bar. I told her immediately this is a bar I used to hookup at and we'd probably run into some of them. She said it was fine and she doesn't mind if I say hi and chat a bit, as long as I'm not flirting with them. I tried to talk her out of it but she insisted she'd be alright and didn't feel like going anywhere else.

And the second we walked through the door it was abrupt chaos, I got swarmed as soon as people realized I was there, this bar is one of the few good ones in town so it has a lot of regulars and it was a Friday night so everyone was there and it's had been a while, I kept in limited contact with some but apparently everyone missed me, it was sorta like a family there before and I just fell right back into that. Immediately some of the girls I used to hookup with came over and started talking to me and the first thing that I noticed pissed of my girl is that before I could introduce her a couple of them asked if I wanted a threesome, which I declined and ibtroduce my girlfriend and their response made it worse: ""she can join too, it'll be fun""

Over the course of the night I was approached about 5 times, and most of the girls I used to hookup with there talked to her about me since I have a bit of a reputation. I saw her getting more and more frustrated as the night went on, I offered to leave several times but she insisted she was okay, I made sure to keep conversation with people short and civil being careful not to come off as flirty, mentioned how amazing my gf was repeatedly to drive the point home.

Anyway on the way out to the car she started crying and pushed me and then the yelling started, a lot of it was incoherent but she was pissed off that ""how am I special if you've been with that many girls"" I tried to tell her I stood with her for more than a night, that all those girls were just hookups or casual fwb and there was never a future with them. She started yelling at me about stds which I reminded her I always used protection and got tested three times since our relationship started and came up clean. And then the final nail in the coffin ""how many people have you slept with?"" I told her she didn't want the answer but she kept yelling at me and told me if I didn't tell her I was walking home, so I did and she shook a bit more,tried to say something, then left without saying a word, i ended up having to take an uber home.

She hasn't talked to me since and idk what to do.

Tl;Dr my gf met a lot of my old fwb and hookups at a bar and found out how high my body count was (50-60 different girls at least) and now she won't talk to me.",0

1256,"Meltdown’s every single day dad leaves for work? Okay so for context I am a stay at home mom and I have been a stay at home mom since the day my oldest was born we have spent every single day together outside of the occasional sleepover with family members or when I have had her sister. 

My oldest is 3 and her dad works 2nd shift Monday-Thursday 2pm-2am she has a 19 month old sister and I am 33 weeks pregnant with my third. 

My oldest is a dream usually but she does have some sensory issues that we are dealing with us and her Dr both suspect ADHD as she is heavily pre disposed due to family history and also possibly autism. She is a helpful, pleasant to be around child 99% of the time but when her dad goes to work it is a whole other ballgame and the fallout always happens between about 3-4pm over something small that has nothing to do with her dad leaving, today it was because I took the cat’s collar (not attached to said cat) away from both girls as they were fighting over it. Cue the meltdown, screaming like I’m hurting her, hitting me, more angry because I will not allow her to hit me for 30+ minutes at a time. Nothing I do works, not a calm voice not gentle restraint, not yelling, nothing. I try to handle these as best I can and mostly be a gentle parent but I am also not going to allow my child to walk all over me, I do my best to understand her emotions and tell her that enough is enough when it’s to much.

2549,"Parental crisis I(20M) find myself constantly fighting with my parents. I feel like they never quite understood me or tried to. Being blunt my dad is a dinosaur moralist and mom is fairly modern but tends to side with my dad during conflicts. They say that they love me and stuff but then I feel that they don't completely trust me. They made me take medical science against my wishes which I never wanted to purse but did so anyway. Last year I failed in my 1st yr exams and they would always blame the most blatant things like me using my phone all the time or sleeping for not passing the exams but wouldn't discuss the fact that I'm trying to do something I have 0 interest in and see no future in it. They didn't even allow me to bring me my laptop with me, stating reasons like I'll play games all day and wouldn't study. They aren't bad people by nature I guess but I just don't seem to resonate with them.
 My Dino dad just has these weird morals like drinking and smoking is an absolute no no(both parents doctors here) and them being Hindu also against eating beef and stuff. Me on the other hand being an aethist have oviously tried it, be it drinks, cigs or weed. But I repeat tho I used to do those stuff I completely cut it off 2 months before the exams and was sober while exam preparation.
It's like even now while I'm repeating my semester they would call and only enquire whether I am studying or not and nothing else and ask about the portions I studied and nothing else.
During locks when I was having inline classes form home they would only ask about my studies and in the evenings ask about what I studied during the days, it got to the point that now I don't even feel like going back home ever and prefer hostel to that.Home feels like a jail or gulag now.
Why can't they ask like simple things like son how are you, have you found the love of your life yet, do you party in the weekends or stuff?or are you enjoying yourself and like studying isn't everything and the most important thing in life is too make memories and be happy and contented with life .

I remember this specific instance when I was caught watching porn at home back during my schooldays and they beat the shit out of me when they found out. But the icing in the cake was that the first time I was introduced to porn was in my dad's phone and ever since then I would watch porn videos that were in his phone gallery. They didn't ever let me drink or party or even have a phone or laptop till my 12th grade when my friends had playstations and laptops.

They never taught me about love, or drinks or stuff like that but if caught were ready to thrash the shit out of me.

Other than that they are really kind and caring people,who would make every occasion memorable like my dad cooking special meals on my birthday or my mom baking me a cake and sweets.

I just feel like they still see me like some sort of a 9 yr old kid who isn't ready for the harsh realities of the world and expects me to like with the same sort of stupid morals they grew up with. They won't ever talk about issues like personal finance or trading or stuff and for them money is not everything and shouldn't be aspired for in life.

1457,"Does anyone else hate hosting play dates? What are your experiences? Having friends over is fun for kids and a part of childhood, I get it.  But omg do I hate hosting.  It’s stressful, messy, and loud.  When the other parent comes to pick up my daughters friend it takes forever for them to get them out the door because no one is listening that it’s time to go.  My daughter (8yrs old) has a lot of energy and so naturally she has friends that are similar.  A 3.5 hr play date just ended and my house is a wreck, and that’s with me paying attention to what they’re doing and checking in.  

We have yet to host a sleepover and I’m putting it off for as long as possible.  I’m dreading the first sleepover we host.

Anyone else with me???",1
452,"All my 9 week old does is cry Pretty much as the title says, he’s almost 10 weeks old. From about 2-6 weeks old we dealt with witching hours and cluster feeding and growth spurts etc and then he had a really good week and I thought haha! We’ve cracked this  thing. 

Now since he was about 7 weeks he’s gone back to crying. Constantly. If he’s awake he is screaming until he tires himself out and goes back to sleep. He’s EBF but boob seldom calms him down and he won’t latch when he’s throwing a shit fit. We’ve tried everything, infacol, gripe water, bike legs, tummy massage, bath (triggers him even more). We follows his wake windows and try to encourage naps as much as possible but he’s a chronic cat napper, his day naps last about 40 mins max. 

The only saving grace is that he sleeps in fairly decent chunks at night time but during that time I’m torn between having time to myself or just getting some sleep. 

My husband and I are both first time parents and we also both have a history of MH and a PPD diagnosis… so the crying is really really hard to deal with. 

Is this something he’ll just grow out of? If so when? Or are we just doing something wrong?",1
2983,"I (19F) like my close friend (19M), who is my friend's ex (18F) I (19F) have liked my close friend (19M) since the beginning of summer, however I never did anything because he was in a relationship with another person (18F). They recently broke up, and since they were dating, she essentially became part of our friend group. Now it feels like I'm stuck in the middle, hearing both sides about a messy breakup that I wanted to happen but now feel bad about, and liking my close friend still while listening to how his ex still likes him as well, but doesn't at the same time. It's complicated because he and I talked in the past, and I think I still have lingering feelings from that. The reason we never did anything is because I liked a different guy at that point, and then he found his ex. She was always a little off about the fact we had talked before as well, trying to bring it up when I was uncomfortable, and trying to get me to talk with her about him in the bedroom, because of our past. 

After the break up, however, his ex latched onto me as her support system, while simultaneously putting me down, almost in front of him, in small ways. I've respected their relationship and the break up, though, and have made sure to never let the fact I like him affect anything, but recently it's been too prevalent and stressful to ignore. 

I texted both of them tonight after a stressful situation, about how I needed time away from them both because I was too close to the situation. I'm afraid that I might have made a mistake by doing so, in case it came off the wrong way to either of them. 

I just want to know if I should continue to ignore my feelings, or confess to him and then hope everyone can still be friends so I can get it over with. I have been getting so anxious about the situation that it's hard to be around them both, so any advice would be very helpful.",0
2298,"My twin sister is too socially dependent on me I (F20) have a twin sister (F20). We are pretty close, but she has always been a more sensitive person whereas I am more blunt, so we get into petty arguments fairly often. But at the end of the day, we have always been there for each other.

For some background context, we have both always been shy, quiet people and a little challenged in the social aspects of life. We come from a military family and constantly moved around growing up. This meant we had to learn how to make friends wherever we went despite being shy. Or at least it did for me. My sister is another story.

Once we reached middle school and moved into our first long-term home (we lived there until after my sister and I graduated from high school), my sister made absolutely no attempt to make friends at school. Like she would straight up not talk to any of our classmates besides me and the friends I made. I don't fully understand why. The only thing I can think is that she might suffer from some degree of social anxiety. Once we reached high school, this all started to become more of an issue.

I feel like my sister started to follow me everywhere I went. Any time I joined a club, so did she. Any time I signed up for a volunteer opportunity, so did she. Any time I would go to any sort of after school event, so did she. Even if these things didn't align with her interests and were more my style, she would join them. This always irritated me, but its not like I was going to stop her from getting involved in extracurricular activities. In fact, my parents encouraged her to do this. But again, she would make no effort to make friends at these things. She always just followed me around. It was like we were attached at the hip.

So this was fine, but then she started to invade in on my social life outside of school too. My close friends noticed that she didn't really have anyone to hang out with and started inviting her to join with us anytime we would go out. We sort of became a package deal. Anytime I was invited somewhere, so was my twin sister. I never wanted my sister to feel excluded so I always let her come with me, but if I'm being completely honest, this really irritated me. Being a twin, having a sense of individuality is something I've always struggled with. I've always felt like hanging out with friends is the one opportunity I get to just be my own person and have an identity outside of my sister. Besides, I just don't want to be around her all the time. Because not only did we live together in the same house, but we also went to school together and now we were hanging out in our free time together, too. That's a lot of time spent together!

I thought this problem would resolve itself and go away when we went our separate ways after high school. But surprise surprise, she followed me to college (we are both currently sophomores). This year she even moved into the same dorm building as me on campus, same floor and hall, however we live in different rooms. But now everything is being repeated. She's joining the same clubs and organizations as me. She is not putting herself out there or trying to make friends. Anytime I go to a dining hall she invites herself along so she doesn't have to go alone. Sometimes when I go to events on campus and meet with friends, she follows me even if I didn't invite her. She befriended my roommate so sometimes when I come home from my classes, I walk in and find her in my room hanging out with my roommate. She always knows where I am/what I am doing because my roommate tells her. And she recently changed her major so that we would be in the same field. She jokes all the time that this means we will get to live together forever... but I don't really think she's joking.

I feel like I'm going crazy. I have tried talking to my parents about my feelings on the subject but they just always tell me that this is a problem between my sister and I and there’s nothing they can do. They also told me that because I am the more outgoing twin, I need to “be the one to get things done” and make sure she has a social life. I have also tried telling my friends about my perspective but one told me I’m being selfish and the others just ignored what I said. I even tried discussing the issue with my twin herself, but she just got defensive and told me that there isn’t a problem here, and that there's nothing wrong with being in the same social circle plus its unrealistic of me to want to separate our social lives. I feel like no one understand my concerns at all. I don't really think it is healthy for my sister to be this dependent on me. I worry about her lack of confidence and independence, and I worry that I feed into these problems.

So here's what I need advice on. First, what can I do to help my twin become more socially independent? Even if I can't separate my twin from my social life, I still want her to learn how to function in the real world without me by her side. I can't always be there for her, especially after we graduate from college. And second, what can I do about my lack of a sense of individuality as a result of being around my twin so often? Any other twins out there with this struggle? I know these are loaded questions, but I would appreciate any insight because I am just completely at a loss here. Also I think its important for me to mention that my parents are unwilling to offer any support simply because they do not care, so any and all solutions are on me.

Thank you all so much in advance.

TLDR; my twin sister is entirely dependent on me for her social life to the point that I worry it is unhealthy. She has never made an attempt to make friends of her own and has always relied on me to make friends for her in middle school, high school, and now college. How can I help her become more socially independent?",0
2689,"I cheated on my partner last night On a throw away.

I cheated on my partner of two years last night. My friend confessed his feelings for me and we ended up making out. Nothing more happened because we both knew it was wrong as soon as it started. There's no excuse but here's what happened. I told my partner that I was having a bad mental health day but I guess he was busy because he kind of blew me off saying that if I wanted to talk let him know and he hopes I get over it. We haven't really talked since Sunday. I went over to my friends house and he made me feel better. I ended up falling asleep in his bed and when I woke up it was dark and we were wrapped up in each other. He woke up and looked at me. Our faces were so close we kissed. It was gentile at first, like we were testing each other but soon kissing turned to making out and grabbing. We pulled away to breathe and knew we fucked up. He did tell me that he's had feelings for me for a while but never wanted to come between me and my partner. 
I don't know what to do. Should I tell my partner what happened Wednesday night? Should I keep it to myself and just stay away from my friend? I've never been in any situation even close to this so I really don't know what to do.",0
3231,"Post-Break Up Advice Help with a breakup question

I NEED HELP WIT A DECISION—but its also kind of long so shout out to whoever takes time to read this! —— 

So my girl and I lived together, 3 years together, i believe the pandemic did a big number on use cause before it we were golden, and we even agreed that if the pandemic never happened then we wouldn’t be here wit all these issues, 

but anyways we got a dog together right, I finessed my way of getting our dog to be a service dog so it means we dont gotta pay anything for our dog 

so she broke up wit me about a little over a month ago, the day after my birthday, after going out to dinner with my fam for my birthday, while we were in bed about to go to sleep, i slept on the couch that night, packed my things the next day and she didn’t wanna talk no more so i left.

My name is still on the lease. and me and her both know that if I get my name off the lease, she will have to pay a $300 pet deposit, a monthly $40 pet fee, and have to reapply for the apartment which she would need a co-signer for. i didnt take my name off due to respect for her and i wasn’t sure if it was just a break. but she has now unfollowed me off of everything, and just acts like she never knew me. i also unfollowed her back. i dont reach out at all. i do no contact. but now im kinda fed up wit her shit. so im thinkin of hittin her up so we can meet up and take my name off the lease. 

is this a good idea ? i want to get back with her but not now cause we both have things to work on. but i feel if i do this she will block me on everything, she already threw all of our stuff out. all the stuff i got her. but i just dont wanna piss her off with this but i feel like im just giving her what she wants. these are the consequences of her actions. and i want to beat her to it before she asks me so then i have the power and the upper-hand in a way. 


she was giving mixed signals before unfollowing me off of everything. a few days after the break up she would text me what she made for dinner, sent me links to future concerts this year saying we should go together, talked about how she was excited for when we get house and our dog has her own backyard for the first time. then a few days passed of no contact and boom she unfollowed me off of everything. so i did it back. and now this lease thing is the last thing keeping us in eachothers lives. 

i live wit my parents now. im working out 6 days a week, self reflecting, working on self improvement workbooks from a relationship coach, going to therapy, going on runs, about to get a new job to start my career, in college still ( i was already in school when i was with her ), going out with friends, i am on a good start. and i just dont know what to do about this lease thing. 

I have never raised my voice, always patient, always talked calmly, open minded, never mentally/physically abused her, never broken anything out of anger, listened to her to understand - not to respond. BUT i do know my anxious attachment style was a part of this breakup which is what i am working on now. and she has an avoidant attachment style and always held everything in and i know its cause of how she grew up and my anxious attachment style is because of how i grew up and we need to work on that. but i want her back eventually. we were eachothers best friends, but right now i know we cant which is why im giving her space and shoot, maybe she dont even want me back but either way its a win because i am improving myself wether she sees it or not. 

i just dont want to upset her with this lease thing, cause she doesn’t have a job, she has a unpaid internship and going to school too but she would need to pay for the dog every month, pet deposit, and need a co signer. but this is what she wanted. so im just doing it out of respect of her choice.

2591,"My family always compares me with my female cousins and make me feel useless, unworthy, etc. I don't know if I want to continue having a relationship with them. (we don't live in USA and english isn't my first language)
So I (15F) live with my mum (42F) and my brother (9M)  and we live in an entirely different state. My father lives in a different state due to his occupation. I am a short, kinda curvy, dark haired, tan skined kid. I am no means fit but I am not obese either. I am somewhat in the middle.

So, every year we go to visit my extended family. I love them but they always comment on my weight and compare me with my cousins. I have 3 (17F, 13F, 12M,10M)  cousins from pa's side and 4  (19F, 12F, 5F, 15M) from mum's side to whom I am always compared especially the female ones. My oldest cousin (19F) is a Indian classical dancer, thus she is very fit. Cousin 2 (17F) is also a Indian classical dancer. Cousin 3 (13F) is like me in physique but is probably 5 shades lighter. Cousin 4 (12F) is very skinny and a singer. And me, well I am the average 15 year old who likes art and writting. 

So the comparison started from my childhood. Whenever I visited them comments like 'oh you have gained weight' , 'oh you look healthy', 'did you sit in the sun too long? You have become darker', 'I know this home remedy that will have you fairer', 'Don't eat this, you'll become more fat' etc were the first words after intial greetings. I admit it hurt but I always forgave them considering they are my parents' family thus my family.

But what broke the camels back were two incidents. Last time when I visited, my aunt somehow convinced my mum that I needed to see a professional because I was too fat and to my surprise mum agreed and basically forced me to go to an unauthorised clinic for weightloss. After my mum's decision, my only hope was my pa, but he only agreed with them. This broke me and from that day I have had body image issues. 

The next incident was in my father's house. One of our relatives was helping us do some shifting, when he commented how he thought I wasn't my parents' child as both of them are tall and I was short. He also made fun off my weight and compared me to his daughter who was 8 months pregnant. All of this happened in front of my father but he did nothing else other than occasionally laughing with him. 

My father also always comments how fat I have become everytime he comes to visit us. Last time he came, he put me on a low carb diet or basically starving me. These incidents pretty much have destroyed my self esteem and my body confidence. 

Now everytime i eat, I don't feel the joy of eating anymore, all I ever feel is  constant anxiety about how much calories I am consuming. 

Last Monday, mum metioned visiting our relatives but I really don't want to. I don't know what to do. I am being unreasonable?",1

546,"Uneven household duties and resentment We have two kids, a toddler and a baby. We both have full-time jobs, and we have a nanny for childcare. My husband recognizes that I do more than him with the kids and around the house. Way way more. I'm fine with a split that slightly puts more on me, but we're beyond that. My husband has hobbies. He has time for himself everyday. He will ignore the kids for his hobbies and his phone. I have reddit, i guess. We both work full-time, though he works 10 hours/week more than me. 

We're in a cycle of resentment, which I know isn't healthy. He wants me to be grateful whenever he does anything around the house, and he doesn't want me to point out any mistakes. I resent the idea that I should be grateful when he does anything, since he said really be doing that stuff anyway.

For example, yesterday he watched our daughter around lunch so I could take our son to urgent care. He forgot her naptime. When I got home, she was a mess, and I told him that he needed to put her down for a nap. He got mad at me for not being grateful that he watched her. He was upset that I criticized him instead. I'm just pissed that he expects me to thank him for doing his duty as a parent. Also, he knows that she goes down for a nap at the same time every day. He frequently puts her down, but he was just distracted by his phone yesterday.

How do we break this cycle? Should I just suck it up and be thankful when he does anything? We're in therapy, but we mostly focus on his feelings in those sessions.",1
2303,"I (f22) dont know how to argue with my bofriend(23). Dear Reddit , please excuse any mistaks in this post, im from germany, english isnt my first language.

Me and my boyfriend are toghter for 4 years now.  I really love him, and he helped me a lot in my own development.

Up until spring our relationship was amazing but Covid19 got us into a pretty bad situation.  I had lost my job and had to change my work place and got to a very low/depressiv point.  I seeked help via a psycholochist but i wasnt successfull.  So my boyfriend told me he wanted to break up.  A day later he got back on his words and told me it wasnt final he just thought about it. He kept that ""thinking"" up for a couple days until i demanded a decision 1. break up for real  2. work on the flaws .  That was the first time we really argued.  I never argued with someone about such an important matter before, because i was always a puchover who wants to create a happy world. So that day  was the first time i showed so obviously how upset i was.  Despite the fakt that he got us into the situation, i had the to be the adult one and think about a solution. He was crying most of the time or telling me that he didnt know what to do.

We started to work on our problems (i lost weight (im obese and he tries to keep that in check, ) worked more in the household,etc. He was supposed to work on his behaviour, help me around the house and work  his way to express himself, cause thats his weakness.

From that point on we argued a lot more.  While i made good progresses he didnt. He had a few good days but i couldnt see the same amount of effort that i put into this. So i got upset and very naggy and bitchy.

So while my problem is the nagging and bitching, his is the anger.

I want to have a satisfying end to a argument. I want to to be able to express my anger, want to hear his side, want both sides to admit their wrongdoings in this situation and an agrement to a situation, but i think im way too pushy about it.

Let me give you an example.

I came home yesterday  and our flat was a mass, the food from tuesday (the amount that was supposed to be for 2 people) was gone and my boyfriend was laying in bed playing on his phone.  So i had to clean, wash, shop and cook for myself.  I was upset and made that clear, it got a little bit heated.

His point was that he did something but i was adament that he didnt so he said ""If you dont believe me so be it!"".  For the rest of the argument he was just repeating that sentence  over and over again.  So he went into bed to play on his phone and i followed, now he was straight ignoring me and i was mad and wanted to force him to talk to.  I grabbed his phone.  He got angry very angry but straight from 0 to 200, so i coudnt see that comming.  He pushed me into the wall and yanked his phone out of my hand. Now i have a little but painfull bruise on my arm were he grabbed me.  We didnt really talk yesterday and i was really dismissiv the whole day while he acted like nothing happend.  A few houres ago we argued about the situation.  

His side:

\-he thought that today everything was alright like always

\-he felt like his privacy and his wish for peace was disrupeted and i was to pushy

\-i shoudnt have grabbed his phone out of his hands

My side:

\-i dont know when he will be agressive towards me (this was the 3 time this happend) since i cant predict it

\-he doesnt understand that he was wrong

\-he didnt apologize or admit that it was his fault

The whole argument concluded with him revealing the fact that he was in anger therapie as a child and the bad habbits are comming back since hes stressed.  I didnt know that bevor. 

His last sentence ""So you know what to do now?"" in the context this means that he wants me to avoid situations were he gets super mad. The situations were i get pushy.  

Im angry right now because he wont understand that this is his responsibility an his alone. I think that he is the one who should change not me, but he thinks its a shared responsibility.

Dear Reddit 90%  of the time he is the most carring and loving boyfriend you could imagine, im always so so happy when i come home and see him. Right now i dont want to consider a breakup. There were never severe injuries just little bruises. And he has his past as well, hes seeing a psychiatrist too.

But i want to know what you think about the situation:

\-What do you judge my pushy behaviour ?

\-Do you argue in the same way? If so, is there a way to make it work?

\-Are my expectations for a argument wrong? Is there a better way?

1282,"Family COVID Plan So, friends ... here we are! My husband and I (vaccinated) are back to work, masks are spotty to nonexistent where we live, and vaccine coverage is not high. As much as I want to stuff my fingers in my ears and say, ""no, it won't happen to us!"" I think there's a strong potential that we could end up getting COVID and that our nine month old would get it, too. While we are being careful, I also feel like we need a plan for what we would do if we got COVID.

I know I tend to make my worst decisions when I don't have a plan in place. 

Obviously, priority number one would be to not spread it within our own home, but priority number two is making sure that we have what we need to care for all of us safely without infecting anyone else. Priority number three is to know when to escalate care and how to do that. Those of you who have had COVID and whose kids have also gotten it, what lessons on how to get through it did you learn from the experience? What might you have done differently? What worked well?

I know it seems a little pessimistic to do this, but I feel like preparation can't hurt.",1

201,"I snapped at my husband and I’m not sure I was right Yesterday, after my daughter went to bed, we started chatting like every other night about this and that. I told him (reminded him) I wanted to make an apointment for her to see a dermatologist.

Context: A few weeks ago, my kid had a mild rash on her hands and later started peeling. An then just like 5 days ago, a big chunk of one of her toe nails broke and fell. None of this was painful to her, so we weren´t as worried.

I wanted to take her to the dermatologist but for one or another reason, I couldn’t last week. Now she seems fine but I still want to take her if just for a check up. Also, the body lotion I use on her after every bath is about to be done so I was thinking maybe the doctor can suggest a new one that care for her specific type of skin (which I now think might be sensitive).

I’ve been talking about it for 2 or 3 days but my husband wasn´t on board with it. He was saying that she doesn´t need it and that the doctor wouldn’t have anything to see because both the rash and the peeling are over. I still told him it would be a good thing if the derma could look at her nails and overall do a check up.

We were very calmed… for a while. Then he told me that if I was to take the decision to take her to the dermatologist by my own, then I would have to endure other decisions he might make about our daughter without taking me into consideration. I didn’t like his tone and asked if he was threatening me. He said yes and I snapped.

I got up and held the plate I was having supper on (which happened to have a knife on it) against him. Wasn’t touching him, but was near him. I yelled at him to never threaten me with my daughter again. I admit I was very shaken and upset, also cursing.

He told me not to talk to him like that and I repeated myself, after asking again if I was beeing threatend. I then asked him if he was going to sleep on the couch or in our bed. He said bed and was still sitting on the couch, so I putt he dishes away and went to sleep with my daughter.

Today I woke up and left for work. Both my daughter and my husband were still asleep. I texted him in order to know if my baby was already awake and overall to see how was she. He replied he was very sad and taken aback at my response last night. He called me violent, offensive, intolerant and rude and remembered I had a knife against him (not really and it was a butter knife…but ok, fair enough). 

He says I no longer respect either our marriage or himself and says I will not be hearing much of him until I go to therapy or at least recognize my mistakes. 

The thing is, I think i didn´t overreact. I just reacted. I took his words as a frontal threat and was not going to let that go as easily. We were talking about MY daughter.

Also, going to the dermatologist is not bad for her. Is not going to be invasive or anything and we do have the money to take her (we agreed she was to have the best medical care we could afford, always). So… was I in the bad? Should I go to therapy as he says? Should we both go? How do I address this issue with him?

I may add that we have a very good relationship both as a couple and as parents. I’m a little lost here and any comment would be well received.",1

All my daughter seems to do is poo and cry even when I try and take her places its a tantrum I'm in a semi-detached house and my neighbours message when she cries I feel like I'm on rock bottom.
I've tried to stop her crying since she was young to avoid the texts but I told her ""kids cry it can't be helped"" she has two she should understand. I'm sorry for this rant I just feel drained.
I told him my mental health is bad I don't even get a minute to brush my hair or my teeth I'm not living I'm existing. If my old self could see me now she would be mortified I don't open my blinds for the stares I get from my neighbours I just want to be a good parent but she's so hard.
My neighbours live with their ear to the wall my daughter is a nightmare and I've had enough. He's of work Monday and I feel like turning my phone of and going out and letting him have a taste of what life is like for me.",1
2044,Social Media former Bf My boyfriend ghosted me about two years ago. Back in March we started talking again and it's been nice on the chats haven't met in person just yet. And to be completely honest with the community here I honestly wish and wonder what it will be like when we see each other again will I say to myself what was I thinking? or will I say I'm glad I spent all that time and to be honest pretty obsessively trying to contact him every couple months to see if he would even reach out. I also found some social media account that  one of his family members has and he's featured a lot and he looks so great and I just you know of course miss him and wish things were different. The worst part of it is he doesn't even know I know about the account and look pretty much every day because I would like to say hey you look great in that outfit and  sexy  and all that good stuff but I can't I have to keep my mouth closed because nobody is supposed to know I know about it so it's like a blessing and a curse at the same time.,0
2708,"I(33m) want to be closer to my niece(20f) but my sister (her mother) wont let me I'm working on myself everyday to be more expressive so I plan to talk to my sister about being a role model to my niece. 

Let me start with a little backstory. I wasn't the most appropriate person ever when my niece was 13 and I was 26. I was in my player phase and when we have little family reunions, I was talking to friends and cousins around my age about the girls I hooked up with. I was also pretty drunk so I bragged that I had girls nude photos and such. I said this all in front of her. I was ignorant, disgusting, and worked on myself overtime. My family didnt really want me around my niece which I didnt really care about at the time. 

Fast forward to maybe just a few months ago, my niece is now 20. Overtime I never really talked to her. I was never a kid type of person and overtime, my sister was used to avoiding me with her. But somehow we ended up coming together when my niece is excited to turn 21 and asked me places I've been to when I was her age. I told her places but I told her not to trust the men around your age unless you have a gut feeling. She then stated, ""oh i remember what you said back when I was younger. I am never going to share photos of myself to guys"". I was shocked and probably thought maybe my disgusting behavior turned out to have her avoid guys like me when I was younger. We talked further more about how she should take care of herself and she was actually listening. 

That conversation kind of never left me. She doesnt really listen to her parents a lot as they keep fighting with each other. At this point I feel a person like her, beautiful,  young, smart and still needs some kind of parental figure to look out for her as a younger adult. But I dont know how to approach my sister and her husband because im certain they still think im a bad figure. What can I do to maybe be more in her life?",0
2910,"Living with an ex Myself (21M) and my as-of-recent ex (21F) had been together just shy of 3 years and have been living together for 2. We were sort of rushed into it as both our parents had a habit of kicking us out when each other’s houses was the only other place we could go.

We moved away to the country and away from the city we grew up in as Coronavirus came around and although we had nothing to do up there we had each other and, at least to me looking back now, we were very happy.

My ex had been out of work some 9 months before we started dating, due to her depression and anxiety and when we moved in together in the middle of nowhere, she had no option but to continue this despite her obvious improvements once she was settled in a secure home with me and no worry of being kicked on the street.

We moved again, August 2020 back into the city and into a shared house with a group of our mutual friends. Again, life was amazing together here too.

The problems came after that house. July 2021. Another shared house, with one of the tenants from before and his new girlfriend (also both 21M/21F).

My girlfriend finally managed to snag herself a job as throughout the pandemic, nobody was hiring and she was having an increasingly difficult time while having to admit to employers that she’d been off on mental health sick for 2+ years at this point. 

She’s worked in a nightclub now for the last 2 months, and over those two months she’s completely gone off having sex with me, going out with me, doing anything with me. It was obvious something was up but she got annoyed if I asked and was blissfully ignorant to how she was making me feel.

I walked her to work on Saturday. She was still off with me then, mere minutes after she entered the building she told me she hadn’t loved me for months and needs her space.

I haven’t seen her since as she’s been staying on a friend’s spare bed. This third house of ours is the only one she’s contributed to (as she got the job the same time we moved) and she’s told our housemates she will continue to live here and support rent and bills but I feel like I deserve more than a simple text and block.

I’ve accepted that the relationship is over, looking back I fear I was taken the piss out of a bit, financially. I just thought she would show some kind of remorse for it, or even an ounce of respect after all I’ve done in her name.

I know that she’s improved and changed significantly in the last 2 years, she may be the healthiest she’s been mentally in years. So I get that I might not be the one for her anymore, but why wouldn’t she say that months ago when she said she started feeling that way?

TL;DR: 3 year girlfriend spent last 2 years living with me for free while I helped improve her mental health. The second she got a job she admitted she stopped loving me but allowed us to move into another house together. Now she wants to carry on living here but hasn’t been home since 28 August so I’ve not yet had the chance to ask about us or speak about the situation.

I’m not really sure what specific advise to ask but I just need a way to cope with all this.",0
2315,"Posted this in r/amitheasshole but it got removed, because u can't post anything based on relationships I guess. But i want to hear your opinion on this? So for context, Habbo is like this game where the players can create their own Habbo avatar, live in the Habbo hotel and they can design their rooms, chat with other players, take care of virtual pets, play some games and all other stuff like that. 

I'm 18M and my gf is 19F. She's born just three months before me. But anyways, my gf started playing Habbo like a week ago and she found some new friends. They're all dudes and she is on discord voice chat while playing with them.

Now today she told me that she has a ""boyfriend"" in the game and it's one the dudes she plays with. And that just pisses me off a lot. I don't know if I'm just super jealous and the asshole here, I want to hear your opinion. I mean I don't mind that she plays only with guys, I just son't understand the ""boyfriend"" thing in Habbo.

After she told me that I texted her something along the lines of ""😂😂 heyyy"" and I said that I don't mind it's just a game. But in reality it pisses me off.

I've noticed that my girl likes attention from other guys. One time when she was drinking with her friend a bunch of dudes came to the houseparty they were having and started flirting with her. I don't know the whole story but she didn't like push him off and talked to him for the qhole night. And when she told me that I just played it off cool, because I didn't want to get mad, but then she got mad because I wasn't jeaous. And other stuff have happened where I have noticed that she likes getting attention from other guys. I think it has to do something with the fact that she is insecure with herself.

She has his new ""boyfriends"" snap and also snaps him sometimes. And she got very mad at me for wishing happy birthday to a girl in my school for example, she doesn't want me to talk to any guys (which is perfectly fine i don't talk to any other girls.)

Please tell me what to do. Redditors, I need your judgement.",0
288,"Night time separation anxiety? Hey Parents!

Just wanted you all to know the last post of mine on here helped a bunch with all the helpful advice. Got a new one! 

Little man got sick over a month ago and we spent many a nights with him on our chest. Now for the past couple weeks he has been waking within 2 hours of going down, and again around 11:15 and 11:30. Like. Clockwork. With my previous kid, I would go in, pat on the back/butt for a moment until she calmed down. With him, he only cries harder until we pick him up (big mistake I know). We are pretty damn solid on the bed routine but it's after he's been down for awhile that he starts waking up and crying. Wife has been bringing him to bed after the 11p waking (another big mistake I know) but we are both full time workers too and we need some sleep. Any advice would be great! Thank you all in advance!",1

I just... what on earth is that going to be like? What will my schedule look like with both a toddler and a newborn? How can I help my daughter get along with her little brother? She will have no clue why her mother isn't snuggling her or playing with her as much and I'm worried I'll lose my beautiful sunny child to jealousy and resentment.

2618,"My boyfriend’s secretely using drugs behind my back The thing is we (f24,m27) live together for a year. We experimented on some mdma and it was fun and all, then we quit. After some time we tried together meth and then we agreed it’s for the last time. Another week, he said he had some leftovers and he wants to get rid of it by taking it. I was against it but he really begged me, so I said he can use it but really for the last time. He said it is small amount and that it’s for the last time. He promised he’ll take just this one line. In the evening he went to his friend which I know he use basically everyday, he even lost his girlfriend over it. The next day I woke up and my boyfriend was still awake, so I already could tell he used another line with his friend. Later that day I texted him asking if he had another and after some time he texted me back saying “yes I had with my friend”. I was angry so I texted him I thought we agreed on something and he said he fucked up. Later that day I found bag with coke in his stuff and I didnt know what to think so I didnt tell him anything about it. The thing is he didnt even apologize to me, he had his puppy eyes all day but that was it. Like he didnt even notice he totally broke our trust and that it really hurt me.. Do you think he will be using again or am I just being paranoid? I stopped using just right after we agreed on it and I would never use behind his back like he did. It totally scared me and I am disappointed. What should I do?",0
2851,"Bf (27M) never invites me to his out of state plans So backstory - I (27F) have been dating BF (27M) for about 10 months now. It’s a pretty serious relationship, we’ve met each other’s families, he came to my cousins wedding, and spent the holidays together. Currently he’s out of state visiting his cousin (24?F). He’s been there for 2 weeks and is coming back next week so staying a total of 3 weeks.

My issue is not because he went away, I don’t like being attached to the hip and independence in a relationship is healthy. My issue has been because of his reluctance to include me in ANY of his out of state plans. I mentioned maybe flying out for Labor Day Weekend since I’ll be off and spending 3 days there with him and his cousin. He said no because he feels it’s rude to invite me to a house he is a guest at. I understand but I felt that we could have gotten a hotel just while I was there, to which he said why would he do that when he already has a place to stay. I was a bit upset but I was like ok I get it, no big deal, enjoy your family time. 

Our big fight happened 2 days ago when he casually mentioned over the phone that he was going to be out there again for Halloween because his cousin and her friends are having a party. I got upset because he didn’t ask if I wanted to do anything here, or even attempt to make any plans with me. So I asked if I was invited and he said no. Which at this point I was so upset and told him I don’t understand why I can’t come. His response was then when in October can he go back again without me getting upset. Again I don’t understand why I wouldn’t be invited or why he has to go back so soon after spending 3 weeks there. I got so upset at this constant exclusion that I told him we should take a break and talk when he gets back. I feel like him making plans without ever including me is inconsiderate as fuck. He said I’m overreacting, that I’m not his mother to be checking in with and that taking a break over him going to a party is ridiculous. 

Also he and his cousin were planning on going to a music festival in Vegas in November and again - I’m not invited or included even when I asked. 

I of course respect his relationship with his cousin, I know they’re close but I feel hurt that at this point I’m constantly being excluded.  

TLDR - boyfriend is constantly going out of state to hang with cousin, making plans with cousin, and always excluding me",0
1218,"UPDATE: I spoke to my son’s teacher about his test being ripped up in class. 
If any one who originally commented is curious, or want to see my first post:

Original post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r//comments/p8fsd6/my_sons_teacher_ripped_up_his_test_to_shame_him/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)


So, I know some of you parents just KNOW in your gut when a teacher, or anyone really, seems to have an unspoken problem with you, or in this case, your child.

I grilled my son a little bit more, to get more of the story, and it turned out to be a substitute teacher.

His teacher never responded to my email about what happened. So after school, when most of the kids left, I asked her if I could get more information about what happen. You know how someone over explains and fidgets when they’re uncomfortable? This is what happened. All I asked is what happened. She says “well, we asked him about 10 times to stop talking and she finally took his test when he looked at someone answers. But it’s okay! He apologized.”

I asked “apologized for what?”

She says, “for disrupting the class. I wasn’t there, though.”

So I asked to speak to the substitute. She starts the same way. “I took his test because I asked him to stop talking and he didn’t, and after asking him a few times to stop and take his test, I took it away.” So I asked where the ripping paper part of the story came from. She says “I didn’t rip his paper.” So I pressed and said “he wouldn’t make that up, though, unless he saw you do it.” Then she says, “oh, well, when I took it away, I tore a small rip into it to remind me his test was unfinished and that he had to retake it. He didn’t have to retake it during recess, so I’m sorry if you felt that was unfair or something.”

This rubbed me the wrong way. I’m not stupid, and I know my son struggles to pay attention sometimes, but I didn’t appreciate the implication that I was willing to chastise them for discipline without getting the full story first. I feel like they automatically assumed I was going to argue about it. The half apology was also insulting. I know most of you can tell when someone clearly doesn’t like your child, and I’ve been getting that since I first met his teacher. “Oh, you’re ___’s mother. His preschool teacher told me all about him.”

That was nearly two years ago? What does his behavior in preschool have to do with how you think he’ll behave now? I think the fact that he’s sobbing nearly every morning before going to school is very telling.

I don’t think she’s wrong for getting frustrated with him, nor is she wrong for disciplining him. But, I do think she would be irresponsible to have a little office gossip dictate her entire opinion of him and they’ve only been in school for a week. I worry she will unconsciously treat him more harshly than others.

How do I resolve this? I can’t always protect him from everyone who doesn’t get along with him.",1
2925,"My(F30) partner of five years(37M)'s only sister is getting married in one month, and I just got uninvited to the wedding. TLDR:  My bf of 5 years asked me to stay home from his sister's wedding because 1.  It's limited to 40 people, 2.  He will be too busy with his duties and 3.  His family doesn't accept me, really.

Background: I'm an American living in Korea, my boyfriend is Korean and we have been together for 5 years, living together 4, postponed 2020 wedding indef due to Corona.  His family never really loved the idea of me, but I thought they had accepted me by now.  Originally they forbade my bf from being with a foreigner, but my bf refused.

Conflict:  So for the past 6 months, my bf and I have been making plans around his sister's wedding.  I got a dress, we figured out our work schedules to go, etc.  It was a given that I was going.

Laat night we were eating dinner and he asks me if I don't mind staying home.  The reasons he gives are that due to Corona, it is limited to 40 people.  And he will be busy with family duties (which are intense for a Korean wedding, as he is acting as the head male of the family as the dad is out of the picture).  And also that one of his cousins doesn't like me (while the other's I could understand, this one felt 100% like an excuse). 

Logically, I can understand the Corona situation.  But that I would be bored?  Yes, there is a language barrier, so I understand that, but am capable of taking care of myself for 1 hour or 2 hours.  It feels like what he's saying is that they will be uncomfortable with a foreigner around them.  I've met all of his family members over the last 5 years, cousins, aunts, uncles, I've gone to cousin's weddings.  

I feel like this is a core family event that I literally got uninvited to, and I'm so confused as to what to think or feel.  I want to be understanding, and grown up about it, but I feel like I'm not considered part of the family and they are purposefully excluding me from a family function.  It's not a cousin or distant relation!  It's his sister!  5 year relationship and I'm not one of the 40 friends and family.

At this point I'm at ""if I'm uninvited from her wedding, she's not invited to mine"" which of course is impossible, so the only course of action seems to break up! 

Am I overreacting and should just get over it and stay home?  He saw me upset and tried to reinvite me, but I wouldn't ever go at this point, you can't unring a bell.

What should I do?",0

815,"My 3 year old had her first day of school and the teacher had bad things to say I’m feeling really bad because when I picked my daughter up one of the teachers said that she didn’t follow directions, she didn’t want to sit down and eat lunch, she wouldn’t lay down or be quiet to take a nap, that she was too touchy with the other kids (she said she thinks that she doesn’t understand the difference between classmates and her siblings/cousins yet) and that she even pushed a kid which really shocked me. She also had two accidents, luckily I packed two pairs of underwear. I’m not being too hard on her because I know she’s only 3 and it’s only her first day but I’m so stressed out about it.

She said that she wasn't sure if she wanted to continue to the relationship.

831,"Birthday party expectations vs reality. RSVP? And teacher didn’t give everyone an invite. I sent my daughter to kindergarten with enough birthday invitations for her entire class. She came home with many leftover and told me her teacher didn’t give them to the kids that “weren’t good listeners”. I don’t know who, or how many, were excluded. Just seems weird to me and I’m not sure if I should do anything about this part. Ever had anything like this happen, think it is somehow justifiable? 

I also requested parents RSVP so I could plan for food and goody bags. I had one parent respond yes the same day and then nothing. 

I have since then read that many people fail to respond at all. So what do I do? I don’t want to be prepared for 20+ kiddos and not have them show up, nor do I want kids to show up and not have goody bags/food for them.

We are having her party at a park because of Covid. I included on the invite that we would have a bounce house, bubble guns, face painting, goody bags, a cotton candy machine, pizza, and cupcakes. Hoping that would get people really excited and we would have a good turnout. I have zero friends here. Just wanted to give the kids a good time and meet people. 

I wish I had also said “no gifts please”, but didn’t want to sound rude. I always believed gifts were optional but apparently it’s expected and maybe a reason people choose not to come? 

Our area is mostly conservative so I doubt most parents would be avoiding parties due to COVID. My husband and I were the only ones wearing masks at the kindergarten orientation day. 

So what should I do? Ultimately this party is for my little girl and we will make it awesome for her even if no one shows up. I just don’t know if I should expect kids to come if their parents haven’t even bothered to let me know they are coming.",1
2061,"Should I be mad that my boyfriend keeps asking me to go out knowing I can't afford it right now? My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 months. We are very different. He lives in a rich area with parents that pay most of his bills because they have money. I am a lot poorer, no parents, and pay my own bills.

He only eats out, never just cooks at home. I hate myself and am kicking myself now because I spent a lot of my savings going out to eat with him and that's all he ever wants to do it seems. God that area is expensive! But I didn't want to look poor to him or be like ""I'm so broke can you pay for me?"" But I am in an unpaid internship now. Today he asked me on two dates, knowing I'm not getting paid for working. And he doesn't believe in paying for the girlfriend even sometimes. And I get it I'm not entitled to his money or anything. 

But do I have any right to be a little irritated that he's asking knowing I am not getting paid to work? I'm not holding sex back from him or anything. But it's like why ask me on a date right now? I can't afford to keep up with your lifestyle anymore and you don't want me cooking at your house. I don't want to drive 35 minutes to your house and watch you eat lunch and dinner in front of me while I eat bread. (Omg he doesn't like the idea of to-go either, has to be sit in) It's a waste of gas money and time spent studying. 

Idk I don't want to sound entitled, but I don't see how we can keep hanging out if he insists on always going out to eat. I mean if he would do a Togo order then a least I could watch TV and eat something packed while he eats. I feel embarrassed taking a sack lunch into a sit down restaurant, especially in that area. Is that wrong? And even when I eat before I go over there he is still going to want to go out and eat twice a day. 

What do I say when I tell him I can't go out to eat anymore up there when I'm with him and he gets mad?",0

so apologize for the long text &amp; grammar but I’m gonna sum up the relationship::)) me (F21) and my bf (21M) been together for almost two years and we do stay together I move in with him every time we get together (his request) we were rocky last year causing separation for about 2 months and got back together but in the time of us being “separated” we talked to other people but when we got back together I completely left those people where they were (behind) and he didn’t? He still texted the people he was talking to after making up hiding messages and hanging out with other girls. Months went by we got back stronger I guess and we still fight sometimes about the same stuff (him texting other girls) he does stuff and feels some type of way when I do it back. But I honestly feel like I try to be the best gf ever I don’t text guys, cheat, stuff like that but I always seem to feel insecure? Back when we broke up I found out he was messing around with others when he told me I was the only one he was having sex with? So I still feel insecure, but he says he loves me and wants to be with me forever. I can admit I’m a softy? When it comes to him. I don’t yell back at him when we argue cause I’m kinda scared of confrontation? I do know that I love him and want to be with only him? I just want to know how others felt? We have open discussions about our relationship problems sometimes but it always ends like I’m in the wrong? I just feel guilty for everything? I want our relationship to be so perfect it feels hard?

We get along well for our daughters sake but I have huge issues with trusting him to have our daughter at his house alone. He has never done anything to create these concerns, I just don’t trust anyone with her. She has never spent a night away from me. Up until now, her dad has been coming to my house Friday - Sunday every weekend to watch her while I work (I work 13 hour shifts but get home around 10pm so he’s alone with her all day but I can still check on her at night.)

Recently he has expressed a wish to alternate weekends. I am fine with this if it continues at my house, but he wants to take our daughter to his house every other weekend. I know it’s his right as her dad but I can’t help but be concerned at not being able to check on her during the night. His house is tiny and looks like a teenage boy lives there, there’s no toys or bed for my daughter there, and it’s right on a busy road so our daughter could easily step out into traffic if he didn’t wake up with her in the morning or if he took a nap while watching her (I’ve noticed he does this frequently at my house).

Could anyone give me advice on how to alleviate my concerns and become more comfortable with this arrangement? I know they need time together outside of my home to bond but I just feel like she’s too young. Thanks.",1
564,"Any parents read this book, ""Toddlers Are A**holes: It's Not Your Fault Bunmi Laditan""? Hello,

I bought my son (just turned 3) a Melissa &amp; Doug stamp set last night and had him try it out this morning. He was cooperative at first, but then shortly after 5 minutes he broke all patterns. Mixed colors, stamped on hands, face, it go on his eyes.

I watched him for awhile and then told him (in a very nice and patient tone) to not mess with the eyes, stamp one color at a time, count the stamps and count the colors.

Obviously it did not go well and all hell broke loose. I Googled, ""encouraging a toddler to understand rules and patterns"" and a book called ""Toddlers Are A\*\*holes: It's Not Your Fault"". I'm curious to know if any of you have read this book before? The title says it all I would assume. lol

1332,"My daughter is a troll For the last couple of months my daughter has been sleeping from ~9:30 pm to 7:30 am at the latest. Most of the time she’s awake ~7am. 

I’m a teacher on summer break (we go back to school next week), yearning to sleep in but I know that with a toddler the latest I can get is 7:30 and I’ve made peace with that.

It’s now 8 am and my daughter is still sleeping. Good right? Not really because I’ve been awake since 5 am (don’t know why, I woke up and haven’t been able to go back to sleep ever since). 

The ONLY morning in my entire summer break she sleeps in, I’ve been wide awake since before dawn. Well played baby girl, well played !",1

1710,"My girlfriend moved in with two guys ever never met in school I have been with my gf for two years. She goes to school out of state but we were together before she went to college. So we are long distance half the time. I found out my girlfriend was moving in with guys way after she decide to do it months ago. 

I love her a lot and I admittedly think I have some kind of attachment issues as I did not have my parents growing up.

Anyways she’s there now and I’m stressing the fuck out and I feel pretty worthless and lame that I told her months ago how much I hated that she was doing this but she always had excuses about options or this or that.

How am I supposed to trust the person I’ve been with for two years sleeping across the hallway from some guy ive never met in my life hundreds of miles away.

It hurts me so much that I almost wish I never met her so I did not feel so upset and betrayed. She swears she is loyal and would never hurt me but I highly doubt it at this point. I would never move in with girls she didn’t know.",0

1321,"Having unvaccinated toddlers around unvaccinated adults Hey all. Just as a disclaimer this post is pro vaccine and masking so please be kind. I was wondering if I could get some input. My family has just informed me Im the only one they know staying home and masking and not taking my kids out right now. Apparently they feel sorry for my kids because I am imprisoning them and I am being crazy.  I’m just devastated right now.  I have two 3.5 year olds.  They can’t get vaccinated obviously.  My spouse and I are both vaccinated. I don’t push vaccines or masks on anyone ever. We just started staying home again when mask mandates were lifted and Delta variant hit. We were going out prior to that and trying to give our kids somewhat of a normal childhood as much as we can. My parents will not ever get vaccinated and are anti mask now as well.  They go out all the time with zero precautions.  So I said I do not feel safe spending time with them right now as things seem to have gotten worse again and they are now anti mask. We stay pretty isolated.  It’s hot here so we can’t go outside much.  We try but it’s just so hot.  So yes, we are very isolated again :( it’s not because we want to be. Pretty much no one in my state wears masks or distances or anything anymore.  My parents are making me feel like I am imprisoning my children unfairly and ruining their childhood due to my own mental health and anxiety.  It’s making me feel awful.  I’m just trying to keep my kids safe.  Am I crazy for not having them around people right now?  I mean people won’t even take basic precautions when I politely ask or suggest that taking precautions would make us feel more comfortable to visit.  :(  I feel like I’m living on a different timeline or planet than almost everyone else I know sometimes.",1
3096,"Why can't I [20 f at the time] get over this situation with a date [22m at the time] from over to years ago? Sorry it's long, I just want a clear picture :(

&amp;#x200B;

After recovering from a breakup from an abusive relationship, I decided to dip my feet back into the dating pool. I agreed to a date with someone I matched with and with whom I shared mutual friends and we went out to dinner &amp; a movie. At the end of the movie, he kissed me. The kiss grew more intense, and he groped my crotch. At the time I was shocked and confronted, but dismissed it as 'nothing' and when the kiss ended and he said, 'Back to mine' I muttered a meek yes. It sounds awfully naive, but I was very innocent at the time having basically no dating experience. So in my mind, my yes was a yes to 'would you like to keep talking and getting to know one another.' Besides the grope, everything had been fine so I didn't mind chatting a little longer. 

When we were walking outside though, in a cocky way, this man said, 'Tonight's been good, but it's going to get better.' Oh heck. I thought. Heck. Heck. Heck. He wants SEX! On a first date! I couldn't believe it! I was not that kind of girl, I'd even been very clear in our original messaging that I had high values and physical intimacy was something very important to me, to have it on the table early. I disassociated at this point; I remember walking down the street but feeling like the world around me was lethargic and surreal. When we got the cars, I asked him to stop, I had to tell him something. Mustering my courage I said, 'I don't mind vising your house for a bit, but I don't want to do anything physical. Plus I'm on my period anyway.' I thought that would be a sufficient deterrent and it seemed to be. 'That's fine,' he said, 'Let's watch a TV show.' At the time, I was glad of his respect. I was stupid to agree to visit, but I'd already agreed and felt obliged. 

We kissed a bit more, and chatted a bit, albeit in a bit of a sexualised flirty way - but I'd already set my boundary so naively I thought I would be safe. When we arrived at the house, I went inside and was expecting to sit on a couch, have respectful conversation and watch an episode and leave. Instead, he got inside, bypassed the seats and tv because it was 'too small' to sit on &amp; v-lined straight to the bed and before I knew it, he'd stripped of his clothes! What! Why was this happening! I froze at that moment. A true, honest: can't think, can't speak, can't operate threat response freeze. 'You don't have to take yours off, I just don't like clothes in bed.' But I barely registered. The world felt so overwhelming to deal with. This wasn't what I agreed to. 'You right,' he basically laughed at me, in that cocky voice. 'Yeah,' I muttered in the freeze state. Then stood still some more. But he was moving and I couldn't stay there forever. I could speak to leave. I couldn't move. All I could think was do something. Do SOMETHING. And suddenly, unconsciously, I took off my dress and went on the bed. I have no idea why I did that. 

He tried to get the Ipad to watch a show, but then I squeaked, totally consumed with anxiety, can't we talk. Stupidly, I tried to do 'get to know you' chat. Looking back, he was barely into it. We kissed and cuddled some more. The next question was to take my bra off, so he could 'touch my back' better. I said wait, spent a few moments in total panic, then complied. There was so much anxiety in me at this point: how the hell was I in this situation after I set that boundary? Overwhelmed, panicked, stressed, what I did next was unthinkable. It felt like a compulsion, I touched his crouch - 'is this okay?' 'How about your mouth?' he said. No. This was it. Why was this happening. Why? Why? 'Do you have a condom?' I asked, a last-ditch effort. He expressed disdain at my period. Holy shit. No! I didn't want to have sex. No, not sex, no no no! I said... I said weakly, 'STDs.' I don't have any, he said. And then my last defense was gone. And I was numb, and anxious and borderline disassociated again and I felt totally as if I hadn't an option. And so I complied. 

In the encounter that followed, I was choked, ask him to stop, and later was choked again. I asked not to be 'mouth fucked' (a disgusting term) and I was. In denial, trying to save myself the shame of getting myself in this stupid, compromising situation, I timidly said I didn't usually do this (I NEVER did this! EVER!), I tried to talk of another date to lessen my anxiety. When I implied that I would leave soon, it was implied that if I left he'd get 'blue balls' and 'cry' - I felt trapped. When I did get to leave and go home, it took a while for events to come into focus. 

This wasn't right, was it?",0
2957,"How do I stop myself (M21) from thinking my semi-LDR gf (F21) is cheating on me? I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about a year now 
But I can’t seem to stop thinking she’s cheating on me. I don’t have any proof other than someone messaged me screenshots of her on a dating app but she said she hasn’t had one since we started dating. I trust her but at the same time I’ve been cheated on before so I just keep thinking something is happening in the background when I’m not with her and if I don’t hear from her for a couple hours or something it just confirms in my head what’s been going on so I get bent even though I know it’s not true. We had a really big fight about it and almost broke up last night and I don’t really know how I can change to start trusting her, like if I ask how her night went when she goes out with her girlfriends she won’t talk to me for 4-5 hours and I understand that she’s out having fun but at the same time I’m my head I’m overthinking like crazy",0
469,"I'm proud of my son for what he did today. I grew up below the Bible belt where gender roles has and continues to have a major importance in everyday life.

Women/girls did ""women/girly"" things and men/boys did ""man/boyish"" things.

Growing up, I identified more with doing ""boyish"" things than I did with ""girly"" things to the point it caused alot of friction between my parents and family.

I wasn't allowed to play sports, be alone with the opposite gender, wear clothes that wasn't ""feminine""...but I was encouraged to volunteer at church events and join organizations that promoted ""learning how to be a God fearing housewife"".


Eventually, I got older and rebelled. When I let my folks back into my life, the friction came back, but didn't last long when it was found out I didn't give a iota of a flying fuck.

A few years later, I gave birth to a wonderful baby boy.
Right off the bat, I was already being told how I should raise him.

When he was five years old, he had long hair that was down his back. My parents fought me about his hair saying that he looked like a ""girl"" and that he was going to get teased for it.

My dad would also go on a tirade saying he was going to put my son in a dress since he looked like a ""sissy"".

Mind you, there were kids in his class that had long hair. He also liked his hair and was very vocal about it.

They would continuously pushed this in front of him until he started saying what they were saying, VERBATIM, to me. 

They even recorded him saying it...so, I had it cut.

My parents are old school and are stuck in their ways, but this didn't excuse their behavior.

I put my foot down and told them to let my son be and stop pushing the gender shit . We moved far away after that.

My son is now nine. He has been able to express his interest without gender roles and doesnt have any fears of being judged for it. For example, he has been getting his nails done with me for awhile and he always looks forward to it! 

Today, my folks FaceTimed him and they saw his nails...

They were royal blue.

They hit the roof.

I was getting ready to put them in their place...

but my son did it all by himself and didn't stutter AT ALL.

""Girls paint their nails! You're not a little girl! What was your mom thinking?!""


""Umm...I know, I'm a little boy. I like them.""


""Do you know any little boys that had their names painted?""


""Yeahhhh, me and my gaming buddies get their nails painted with their moms...""



""Of course they do...there's no males in their homes...""



""Ummm, what does that have to do with my nails? I do what makes me happy. I do what I want because my mom said it's okay.""



""You're a boy! Do I need to go buy a dress and put it on you!?""



""No grandpa, if you put a dress on me, I'll put one on you.""



I LOST IT🤣 and so did my mom, but she quickly stopped because my dad was pissed.



""I'm done talking and I'm going to bed. You gone end up getting bullied because people going to thin-""


""GOOD NIGHT GRANNY AND PAWPAW!""


-click-



""Boy, that was intense...think I'm going to go snack now""



He hung up on them😂

I know I'm going to get Bible scriptures and a few messages about how sad they are, but in the end, I'm proud of my son for standing his ground.❤",1
2509,"My (23M) Girlfriend (22F) doesn't want to have any kind of intimacy after discovering I was watching porn. My (24M) girlfriend (23F) doesn't want any kind of intimacy because she discovered that I was lying to her about watching porn for the past 4 months. We have been together for over a year and we've lived together for about 5 months. I wasnt watching every day but I was really struggling with stopping and every time she would ask of I was still watching, i would just tell her that I wouldn't do that and I wasnt watching. I was really ashamed and didnt know how to address it.  
Last week she discovered when she was using my computer that I had been lying. She briefly broke up with me and then got back together. It's been 8 days and I haven't watched anything but we've gotten in a fight almost every day and she keeps saying things like she doesnt think she can ever be intimate with me ever again. She still kisses and sleeps in the same bed with me but I cant even be around when shes changing.

2904,"I (31F) have just been told my cancer is back. How do I have the discussion with new guy (32m)? I (31F) just received information that my cancer has come back. I will have a follow up appointment in about a week, and then will be going in for surgery. 

About two weeks ago I met someone new (32M). It’s early days but I am really into him and see long term potential. He does too, and as a result we have had some pretty heavy talks already(religion, politics, money, exes, family etc.) 

He knows that I have had cancer in the past, but two weeks ago I thought I was in the clear… now I know that I am wrong. My doctor is very optimistic that another surgery will solve it and chemotherapy will not be necessary. That said, I’m going to be on crutches for a few weeks. I will likely go stay with my best friend (35M) because I will need help and my place has a lot of stairs. 

I don’t want to keep any secrets, but I don’t want to drop this big bomb on him either. We just met, everything is new and shiny and I’m worried about how he will see me after this. I know I have to tell him eventually but I want to discuss it in person. I am looking for advice on the whole thing: when do I tell him? (we will likely end up back at someone’s house) Do I do it when we are out or before any sexy times happen? After? How do I make it okay for him to gracefully exit if he is it uncomfortable? 

I know this may be a dealbreaker. That’s okay. This isn’t something I have any control over so if someone knows that they aren’t able to deal with this at this stage in their life, I totally understand. I’m just looking for tips on how to navigate this!

1414,"Is my younger daughter, mine? My ex and I both had flat, dark brown hair. So does my father and both her parents. My mother has red hair. No curly hair.

Youngest daughter has bright blonde, very curly hair. Face looks like my ex but nothing like me. At first I just figured it was one of those things since our first looks a lot like me and even has autism like me.

However, I have found out since my ex had an affair and left to be with another man that that wasn't her first affair.

The issue is that my ex, when she found out I started dating 2 years after she left me alone to raise our kids. Demanded I stop dating and let her move back in to resume the relationship. I said no. So she attacked me until I got a restraining order to stop her then as punishment for getting the order granted she took the kids out of school and has done everything she can since to stop them being able to see me.

At the end of the day, I don't care. I love both of those kids. I spent 4 years at home raising them.

But some people have brought up the fact that the younger of the 2 looks nothing like me and has hair that clearly stands out in 3+ generations of both families.

If I ask for a test to check DNA I just know that my ex will tell our daughters (8 and 10 yrs) the most age inappropriate and toxic reason for the test to turn them against me.

Though having typed that out, I realize I have no guarantee that she hasn't already with the vaccinations.

Still. I don't know what to do. 

Part of me wants to know because since people around us have pointed out things that I just can't forget about. 

Another part of me is scared to because we are in Family Court proceedings and I am worried that if there's medical evidence she isn't mine. Then I'll definitely lose any chance of being in my daughters life...

Lawyers I've asked recommend I do it because it will destroy my ex's credibility in court. My concern is less about that and more about breaking my youngest daughters heart.

I'm at a loss as to what to do.",1

In past years she has often swapped items with her 4 year old sister and younger friends but I do not think that is a good idea this year. Thankfully, the school requires a uniform so that takes a lot stress away from clothing shopping.

Without writing a novel I’ll give you a small glimpse of the madness. She’ll lure him into a confrontation by mocking him with a whiny tone. He gets mad, yells and she sends him to his room for ten minutes. This pattern repeats daily. She yells at him daily for very small offenses. Instead of speaking calmly and explaining why he needs to pick up his socks she’ll yell, “I said pick them up!” It’s ugly. FYI she drinks a fifth of vodka every 3 days. 

I keep reading everywhere, “Do not speak poorly of the other parent to your child.” So, what I say to him is, “Think about the other females in your life. Your teacher, aunt, grandmother, best friend’s mom. How do they communicate with you? Do you see the difference? The way your mom communicates with you isn’t the way it should be.” I would be sick if he ended up marrying someone like his mother because was subconsciously drawn to it.",1

We had our daily zoom call during lunch and I decided to drop the “what are we?” question, since its been a month and half since we have just been texting and flirting everyday. 

He basically said that he got out of a relationship a few months back and he says he was genuinely heartbroken from it and he is still trying to recover. He says he no longer has feelings for the girl but the heartbreak has really taken a toll on his mental health. He says he really likes me but he’s not 100% ready to trust someone right now. I told him I understand because I have gone through similar and yes they do suck. 

He told me he didn’t want to waste my time and he understands if I want to see other people, but honestly I think I’m going to wait for him for at least a little while and see how things are a little further down the road.

We started off as long distance and I moved across the  country to live with her in her mums house.  In my alone time I have  done a lot of reflecting on the reasons on why I felt like I needed to  end things with her. Majority of the reasons were from me being scared  about how my life was and being able to commit when I was so unsure  about how my life was going. I am someone who needs my alone time and  felt I lost myself being with her pretty much 24/7. And other things  about the relationship we had recently talked about fixing.

I  have decided to message her to try and reconnect with her. My thoughts  were to live separately and take things really slow which I think is my  main reason for me ending it. I felt it was going too fast and I had  lost all my independence. But anyway this is the message I was thinking  of sending. This would be followed up with a more in depth explanation  and to hopefully end up meeting up again. What do you all think?

Hi \*\*\*\*\*.

I  understand if you don’t want to hear from me, but I just wanted to  apologize to you for the way things went and the way I treated you. I am  sorry. It was incredibly selfish for me to push you away the way I did,  I never wanted to hurt you. I was scared and struggling with myself. I  just wasn’t coping, and I regret not talking openly to you about my  issues. I hope with time, you can forgive me. You are my best and  closest friend, and I will always love you.

My husband and I just spent the last week getting my oldest son to and settled at college. We made a 30 hour drive to get him there, with his car, spent considerable money on hotels, food, gas, dorm supplies, and plane tickets back home. We got back home on Wednesday evening. Today, he calls me telling me that his advisor told him he can take classes online, so he wants to come back hime and do that. 

Now, for some back story. I have spent the last year trying to gently convince him that he would not be happy so far from home. He’s a family person and likes the familiar.  This school had a great program though, and he was sure it was all that he wanted and that it would make his dad really proud.

Even before we left, my son was rethinking the whole plan and was very unhappy at the prospect of leaving, and he was also very morose during the whole trip there. 

I, thinking I was doing the right thing, did ask him if he still wanted to go, but did not push him to take a step back and put things on pause, mainly because I thought it would have been coming from the selfish place of not wanting him to go. 

So, now, here we are. He’s there and miserable and wants to come home and grieve and be with family, and I don’t know what to do. I assured him that I am not mad at him, because I am not, but I am disappointed that he’s throwing away a major opportunity (the campus and town was AWESOME; also, I did not tell him of my disappointment).  

So, do I relent and let him come back and do online courses?  Do I make him stay at least a semester, which was my original goal for him?  Also, since he’s 18, I really don’t have the ultimate say anymore. 

I am just so conflicted. If not for the trauma that he just experienced, I think I would definitely push for him to stay for a while and give it a chance. However l, given the circumstances, I can’t help but feel that despite everything, this would be the best for his own mental health and that’s all that’s really important. 

Anyway, any input would be appreciated. Also, I would appreciate no negative criticism. This is hard enough as it is. Thanks.",0

So i clamly told her about how uncomfortable it was for me and asked if she could please put a bra on or wear a different shirt out of respect for me and our relationship. She then proceeded to get angry and tell me its ""not my fault men sexualize everything"" and i informed her its not about men its about me and our relationship in general that she should respect me enough not to. Because i wouldn't walk outside with no underwear in a lose white shorts with anything of mine hanging about either out of respect for her because this is a relationship.

1021,"Did the thing I do is correct? I'm no parent here, just a 15 year old trying to be  a good role model (and somewhat of a teacher) towards my younger cousin who is 8 years old.

The thing is, my younger cousin has a best friend who I find quite toxic after observing her for a while, so I advised her to break of their 4 year friendship.

(They do fights here and there, and her bestfriend always demands for her apology in the end. The fight will all end if she says sorry. Her bestfriend seems to always blame other people, making her the perfect one. That was what my grandma said when I told her of the events that occured whenever I was playing with her.)

With a few explanations here and there, and repeating to her what grandma told me, She did it and I was proud of her; being free from her toxic bestfriend.

But the thing is, when I talked to my grandma about this she told me that it was wrong.

She told me that my auntie wanted my younger cousin to be ""flexible"", so that she can get along with anyone in school, work, and etc.

She told me that she needs to be prepared for her upcoming adultlife, and told me that getting along with people will determine how you will succeed in life.

And lastly she told me that her mother will be mad, because their parents had known each other and were friends with each other. And that they will fix what was broken.

Then it dawned upon me. I never had friends in school because they always betray me for reasons unknown. I always thought it was my personality, then again I don't bend who I am for them.

The more I thought about it, the more I felt worse, and here I am talking about it after 2 days of nerve-wracking guilt.

2674,"My girlfriend [F21] talks a lot about herself and her problems to me [25M] and I'm getting tired of it I have been in a relationship with her for 6 months, she has always been like this, she talks a lot and is mostly about herself and her problems, she talks about even the smallest problems or inconveniences to me and I always listen to her and give her some advice, but lately I'm getting tired of it, it's the same thing every time, all we talk about is about herself and her problems and is making me not wanting to talk to her, I would be fine if we talked about her interests and stuff she likes, but all she talks about is her experiences and daily life/problems.

Recently I've talked with her about this, I told her that she always talk about her stuff and never gets interested in my stuff, to her credit she has shown more interest in my stuff, but something inside me doesn't feel it's genuine because I told her to do it and I don't really feel it's real interest, when I tell her my stuff she asks further questions but I feel it's very superficial, like she's not genuinely interested, She asks one question about it and that's it, back to talking about her things, maybe I'm just predisposed, I don't know.

To make things worse, Im not a very talkative person but after listening to her problems I just feel burned out and
I don't feel like talking with her at all, when she asks me questions about me or is my ""turn"" to talk about my stuff, I don't feel like doing it at all, so this creates a vicious cycle that makes the communication unbalanced (Which already was since she talks a lot and I don't talk much), she talks all the time and makes me not wanna talk, so she talks even more to cover that gap wich makes me not wanna talk even more.

Lately I've been getting angry at her Everytime she talks to me about her problems and doesn't ask me questions about my day or about me and even if she did I wouldn't feel like answering them because of what I told you before, so I stop talking completely to her, she doesn't know about this anger and I just tell her that I don't feel like talking to anybody, but in reality is that I don't want to talk to her because I'm angry at her.

I'm planning to talk to her about this but I don't know how to approach her since we already talked about it, I don't want her to stop telling me her problems and sharing with me her personal life but I just feel so burned out, I would be fine talking about stuff she likes, I'm just tired of hearing her personal life and problems.

What should I do ? I love her and I want to work in this relationship, I don't want to feel this anger at her anymore, what would you do ? How would you approach her about this ?

Tl;Dr - my girlfriend only talks about her personal life and daily problems, never about her interests or stuff she likes, this makes me angry and I feel like not talking to her at all, how do I approach her about this ?",0

975,"Help. I need some clarification around  and cleaning! Hi community. My wife and I have three fantastic but VERY active boys. 7/4/2, and I need to vent/seek advice from this sub. 

I work full time and my wife has a very part time job (6-10hrs per week). We agreed to this when we realized retail and daycare don’t work, my career was a bit more further along and she wanted to stay home with our oldest.
About a year and a half ago I got a new job, finally got into an 8-5 Monday through Friday position that allows me to be home about 65% more than I used to be. These days I leave the house at 7 and I’m home by 5:30. 

My wife and I used to be very clean and organized. Obviously having children makes keeping a clean house more challenging and I accept that, the issue is that I don’t feel as though my wife is holding up her “end of the deal”. On the two days a week she normally works. She fully expects me to feed/bathe/clean and put the kids to bed within a 2.5 hour window.
We had to get a friend to watch the boys tonight since I had to stay late for a meeting and when I got home our friend said “she said I’m not cleaning and left for work”. I don’t know why this set me off, but it did.
Clothing everywhere, trash from preparing dinner, all over the place, the boys rooms are destroyed. I fully understand the intensity that our kids bring but this happens on a fairly constant basis.

If I would act this way, she would, and has, flipped out on me.I’m so upset right now but I know if I ask her what the heck happened she would turn it into me not knowing how much work it is, my former job in retail made me never home so I don’t get how hard it is and so on… One of our kids is in school full time, and I just can’t for the life of me understand how she is able to justify this logic.

The few times I have stopped home for lunch or to grab something, she’s constantly on her phone, on tic Tok or Facebook, doesn’t take the kids outside or really play with them and then gets incredibly upset and angry when I ask a question.

I’m sorry for this being long, but I need some advice for how to handle this situation. I’m tired of being guilt tripped for a job I left years ago, and feeling like I can’t ask questions or call out hypocrisy with her.
Any help is appreciated.",1
2517,"Girlfriend being on disability makes our financial future feel hopeless Hello, for the past 3 and a half years I've been in a relationship with a woman who receives disability support due to her mental health issues (BPD symptoms, although we didn't know this was the case until a year and a half ago). At first I didn't think much about her being on disability. We've been living together so long the disability system deducts from her monthly cheque half of what I make every month (between the 2 of us we make about $2500 CaD a month, barely fucking anything). The financial strain is real. We're gonna get her to therapy, but there's a very real chance she's simply..... never able to work, in fact being that I chose to date someone on disabilitymeans I should never expect them to not be on disability, which put our entire financial responsibility on my shoulders.

I may have to get a 2nd job, but simply working one leaves me feeling like I have no free time. My other option is to go back to school, but its depressing as fick to have to pick what I go to school for based off of nothing but what the earning potential is.

I didn't really want to engage the conversation too much as she was meant to be going to sleep, but pointed out that maybe Kid A didn't like Pokemon.

(FWIW - I find pokemon to be duller than dishwater.  She and her father love it.)

Apparently, other kids do the same thing when she tries to play with them.

When I picked her up, I asked her who she played with today and she rattled off several names happily and listed all the things they did.    

She's loud and boisterous at home, but very prone to storming off when told no and not getting her own way.

2874,"i feel like i’ve sacrificed my mental stability/principals to satisfy my partner or for him to not feel like I’m being somehow possessive/compromising his freedom. i’ve been happy for most part with my relationship, however, there is this one part that has to do with the fact that  from the beginning my partner talked about and has always emphasized how he does not want to control or be controlled or possessive by whoever he’d be in a relationship with which I totally agreed and do agree with as I had a toxic relationship previously where I was constantly controlled and possessed over and was horrible and in no way I’m trying to be that way either. there were some instances not too long ago, when we stayed the night at his friends, one morning I was sucking him off and his friend came in, lied next to us and watched us, then started being touchy with my partner and masturbating by our side, which i felt uncomfortable in, but i thought telling that to my partner would make him think I was somehow being possessive or controlling, so I said I was okay with that a few days later when he asked me, then we went there again and he told me his friends wanted to have a foursome with us and asked me if I wanted to join in which I again, even though inside did not feel okay with still agreed thinking maybe I shall give it a try and again, for him to not believe maybe I was compromising his freedom, we started and immediately felt awkward and not okay, could not get any turned on and told my partner, they all stopped and right then I talked to him about how I need to have an emotional/affective connection with the person I get intimate with but felt kind of disappointed with myself as well, he gave me reassurance, but ever since then, I’ve been having toxic thoughts that my partner might be doing such things with other people and the fact that he had been hanging out with quite few gay friends recently until late in the night, which I would never tell him not to, deep inside I was hurting myself having such thoughts. 
Is telling my partner I feel this way will make him think I’m being possessive or controlling or that i don’t trust him? 
I think by freedom he meant in every aspect and probably for him having sexual interaction itself is not really that deep for him as it is for me, meaning having it with other people to satisfy pure sexual desire would not mean betrayal nor cheating.",0
1482,"Toddler towers/kitchen helpers? I am looking at buying a toddler tower for my 22 month old, he has developed a habit of pulling the dining chairs up to the kitchen counter to climb on them so he can play at the counter (apparently flicking the toaster slider is just too much fun!) and I'm not convinced of how safe that is!

I am looking for any advice on buying one. What has been your experience with them? Have they been worthwhile or is it likely to just end up cluttering my (already pretty cluttered!) kitchen? Also, I am curious about whether they can/are likely to tip sideways? I know realistically they shouldn't otherwise they wouldn't sell them, but I do worry!

2101,"I'm a single dad and today I found out I'm not really their dad. Many minds ago at the age of 35 am on off relationship with my then girlfriend was terminated by myself due to her being just too difficult to handle.  Temper, shouting, mind games etc, so I called it a day.     
2 weeks later she came back to tell me she was pregnant and being brought up the way I was, I couldn't have a child born out of wedlock for the child's sake. So I was married early 2001 before my daughter was born.      
The relationship was difficult at one stage I moved out of the home for a while and just visited and then she stated being nice and next thing I know,  there's a boy due in 2006.    
I moved back into the house, but it was again difficult to stay there. I was forever on tenterhooks, getting abusive phone calls at work, dealing with her abuse at home and her drinking. I filled for divorce and it was granted 2008.    
During this time I would have my kids every weekend and every Wednesday and all holidays I could take. She took a job working at night in a restaurant and coming home at 1pm etc and I was the babysitter. It wasn't good to wake my kids and bring them home at 1pm so I stayed at the house until she arrived.      
One day she got a bit amorous and we had sex and again for the next couple of months of and on instead of me going home. Then pregnancy and child 3 arrived 2009    
I stayed occasionally for a little while until she was caught drink driving and crashed into a bus with my 3 kids in the car.     
That was the last straw and since 2010, it's only been in contact to pick up the kids from outside the house. 
She applied for more child support, so I ended up paying her for 3 children and on a decent wage I was struggling to feed myself and had no holidays and few clothes for myself for a good 6 years.     
My then eldest daughter decided she wanted to live with me on a permanent basis and just visit her mum, which I was happy to do...
Roll on some work issues now where I was bullied at work by my manager until I nearly took my own life.  My eldest daughter found out and decided to move back with her mother. Her mother all this time was still drinking and became abusive to my daughter who then called the police. A long story short, I won custody of my other two children, my eldest daughter was to scared to move back with me due to so being on medication for depression so put herself into state care rather than go to her mothers.

3139,"My (20M) gf(18F) and i went on a 'pause' and everything she's doing is messing with my head. Trigger warning: mental/physical/sexual abuse, depression, suicidal thoughts, Stockholm syndrome

TLDR is at bottom

&amp;#x200B;

About four months ago I met this girl going to the same college as me in a discord server. We end up talking for hours every day and find out she's been in multiple abusive relationships and her parents are just as mentally/physically abusive and refuse to give her therapy. Because of this, she developed a ton of mental disorders which she takes half a dozen pills daily and cried about her prior ex (20ishM) sometimes more on him later. Despite this within only two weeks decide since we'll see each other soon enough and we both are crushing very hard to start a long-distance relationship. I'm realizing I ignored the clear reg flags of her mental issues probably because she was the first person to show any romantic feelings for me in about 4 years so I think I just took anything I could get. We even started talking about me driving about 200 miles (4-5 total hours) to see her in the middle of the summer. 

About 2 weeks before I drive down to see her she tells me she's too nervous about it and tells me to postpone it, ok fine. A few weeks later she decides to switch to another college in her city that her parents are pressuring her to go to even though it's objectively worse and she's most of the way through the process of going to my college and paid like 700$ in fees. Finally, I started getting red flags popping up but decide I'm being paranoid and we continue the LDR now for potentially 2 years and we drive to each other periodically to see each other. It sounds stupid I know, but we didn't want to break up because of this and thought it might be a nice ""trust test speedrun"". 

Fast forward a month and she's crying about her ex weekly not just to herself but on-call directly to me. Over the course of the relationship I find out this guy was with her for over a year (so started dating when he was 19ish and she was 16 at the time); I find out he convinced her to stop drinking then shortly after he himself gained a smoking and drinking problem, gaslit her constantly, controlled everything she did, sexually abused her, and even ghosted her for 2 months after which she still ran back to him. Through all of that and after having met me and been with me for a few months she says she still has positive feelings for this guy. On another note, she realized she made a huge impulsive mistake by switching schools and can't get back into the one I'm going to until winter quarter.

About 3 weeks ago she tells me that being with me is constantly reminding her of her ex which explains why her crying about him became more frequent. She also says that we should take a pause until at least the winter quarter so she can stay single and sort through her mental issues especially about her ex. I agree because I don't want to hurt her any more than she already is and frankly hearing about it is taking a huge mental toll on me. After we work this arrangement out we decide not to talk to each other for a week and start a platonic relationship for about 5 months and respark things in-person afterward. 

Since then she had a huge fight with her parents, lived with other family members for a bit, and is now dorming in this program for many other people our age designed to help you learn how to learn and improve your math skills. About a week ago (the 24th) I find out that she slept with someone (age?M) she had just met that same day, told me about it in a bragging kind of way. At this point, I'm in shock and more heartbroken than I was before and I make sure to tell her this. The next day she joins a voice call I'm in with about 5 other people and again talks about how she slept with this guy yet again despite knowing full well that I'm already hurt and annoyed about it. Furthermore, the other people in the call seemed supportive of her doing this even though they all know that she and I had just ended our relationship 2 weeks prior. I'm especially annoyed because she expects me to be ok with it even though the whole plan was for her to stay single for her mental health. Yes, I know hooking up isn't technically the same as being in a relationship but it still doesn't sit right with me. Since then we've talked it out and basically she's expressed she's pissed at me because she has no real commitment to me but also that she regrets it and says she want to stop having sex with people right now too. I told her as long as she doesn't keep telling me that she's hooking up with people my own mental health should be able to get back to a normal-ish state. 

At this point I know I still love her and still want to be with her even though logically it makes no god damn sense why. it seems like she keeps pushing the bar lower and lower until I eventually just snap, and because so many other things about her are amazing, I keep letting her drop the bar. She said she told the guy she slept with that it's done and over but he still is trying to hang around her all the time. Meanwhile, it now takes her hours to respond to my messages because she says she's busy and has a lot on her plate right now. I know she's getting notifications because she checks her phone all the time even in classes (for example: right now she has yet to respond to a message I sent 11 hours ago but I've seen her check Instagram at least 9 times and discord 4 since then). Now, whenever I see she's offline I'm worried she getting her brains banged out by someone who doesn't care about her at all. Given everything I know, I should just cut all communication and move on because she's only causing me pain and I don't think I can trust her ever again even if she did sort her mental issues out. The only reason I haven't done that is she has abandonment issues and I don't want to mess her up mentally even more especially because of how often she has suicidal thoughts. I feel like I committed and mentally invested so much into her, I even put her and making sure she's ok over my own fucking job (which I recently left anyway).  What has she done for me? She said a ton of really sweet things to me and fingered herself on call a few times but never even told her parents that she and I were together and canceled every time I would try to go see her. I'm not taking any of this very well at all and I'm an emotional wreck all the time. Meanwhile, when I talk to her she seems more or less normal and unphased by our breakup. She says she loved me and still does but she doesn't act like it at all. I've talked to at least a dozen people about all of this and they all seem to be getting a little annoyed by it at this point and don't have many other people to talk to about it. After having written this I realized it's ironic that her ex gaslit her to the point of Stockholm syndrome and here she is doing the same thing to me that was done to her.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Rushed into an LDR with a mentally ill girl 200ish miles away. she has many mental issues and traumas most notably depression, abandonment issues, mommy/daddy issues, and attempted suicide multiple times. She cried about her abusive ex but expressed she still has positive feelings for him which I've come to believe is some version of Stockholm syndrome.  Despite all of this and many other red flags, I stay with her until she puts a pause on the relationship until we are in the same college in about 5 months. Only 2 weeks after she sleeps with a random person. Tells me about it, doesn't it again, and tells me again even though I've already expressed the first time how pissed I am about it. I'm totally mentally screwed up and conflicted from everything that has happened but, for some reason that defies all logic, I still love her and still want to be with her.",0
1677,"The girl I’m messaging on tinder might have a partner, do I message the partner? I (21f) am talking to a girl we will call Kenzie (25f) on tinder. The potential partner in question I will refer to as Sarah. We have only exchanged a few messages but I caught a vibe so I decided to do some Instagram snooping. Kenzie doesn’t have anything in her tinder bio about being in an open relationship, just looking for hookups, or just looking for friends. Just normal bio stuff. I’m going to do my best to describe the photos and captions I saw. 
The first photo set I saw was a couple of photos of Kenzie that were taken by Sarah and the final photo in the set is Sarah’s feet on top of Kenzie’s, the caption reads “the fun never ends, it’s adventure time”. This wasn’t that weird but I continued to investigate. Moving on to the tagged photos. The next photo set is posted by Sarah’s sister and the three of them are in Hawaii (none of us live in Hawaii), the caption is very long and talks about how important family is. This is the biggest flag in my opinion. I analyzed the sister’s account and concluded that Kenzie is definitely not related to Sarah because of throwback family photos. Next photo is posted by the sister again and Kenzie has her arm around Sarah and they’re looking at the moonlight on the ocean. The next photo set is posted by Sarah and include 10 photos of kenzie and her together, some where they have their arms around eachother, some where they’re laying down and touching each other’s faces and just regular stand alones of kenzie, the caption reads “her name is Kenzie and I think she’s pretty rad”. To me this reads as introducing your partner to your Instagram followers. This is all the information I’ve collected.
I know I seem like a crazy stalker but once I thought there was drama I was naturally curious. Do you think that I’m reading too much into things? If not do you think I should tell Sarah that her partner might be on the hunt? This is a random tinder girl so I don’t really care if she figures out I was the one who told her partner. 

TLDR: I Instagram stalked a girl who I met on tinder and I’m 95% sure she has a partner. Do I tell the partner?",0

1019,"Toddler Hitting Little Brother My daughter is almost 18 months. She is generally a pretty nice and loving big sister and kid in general but she has recently started hitting. At first it was just my husband and I and my parents (really the only adults she sees because of Covid) and she just started slapping in the face. She would always laugh/smile when she did it so she clearly thought it was like a funny joke. I don’t know if it was because she loves to high five and was like “ooo when I high five in the face I get a big reaction” or just something she started doing because she’s a toddler. She doesn’t do it when she’s angry, always with a laugh or smile like she’s playing. 
We’ve told her that it’s not nice, hands are for helping not hurting, etc but like she’s 18 months so it’s not like she’s fully understanding. 

Recently she’s starting hitting her little brother who is seven months old. She is usually very sweet and gentle with him (patting his head, rubbing his stomach, giving him his pacifier when it falls out, etc.) but sometimes she’ll get it in her mind that it’s funny to hit and just full on hit him on the face or head, sometimes doing it with whatever she is holding. Obviously he cries and no amount of telling her it’s not nice, to stop, etc will make her stop. She will want to keep doing it until physically removed (I’ll usually put her in timeout in her room.) 

The problem is she clearly isn’t getting the idea that it’s not funny because no matter how stern I try to sound she just laughs when I tell her no and keeps trying to hit him. We don’t spank or hit as punishment (not judging those who fo just not something we wanted to do) and I don’t know how to get her to understand that it isn’t funny and hurts him. Even when I put her in her room she cries for like two seconds and then starts playing with toys so I don’t think it’s communicating that what she is doing is wrong. Any advice? 
Obviously she is a toddler and I don’t think she is intentionally trying to make him cry but surely there is something I can do to help her understand that hitting isn’t nice. 

Thanks in advance!",1
385,"9yo getting bullied for being fat 9yo came home and told us he was being bullied on the bus by one kid and he wants us to call the school and get him in trouble. 

His siblings were all big growing up and then hit puberty and shot up to super tall and skinny. Before i get comments saying healthy food and exercise we know and are working on his diet and hes joining football next month, losing weight isnt a quick solution does anyone have advice for what to do because we dont want to call the school and add on that he gets his mom involved in bullying on top of being big",1
1548,"It's been 9 months since our kid was born, and my wife is ice cold to me BRRRRRRRR I say my ""wife"" because she basically is, and it's fewer letters to type than fiancee lol.

We're a pretty typical couple. We were relatively happy and content and were very much in love prior to the birth of our child. We lived together, and traveled, and did all the stuff that non-parent couples do. She was always very kind and gentle. I proposed marriage and she accepted happily and we got pregnant during Covid so the wedding went on the back burner which was fine with us (save $$). The first 3 months of our baby's life my wife was a monster, angry all the time. That was really confusing 0\_o. Then three more months go by, she mellows out a little bit. Another three months, and we arrive at today. She is an ice cold glacier. She's SO MEAN now sometimes and I'm just like WTF who is this person? She's obsessed with the baby (fair enough I understand), but she doesn't give a beaver's damn about me. This morning before I went to work I asked her if we had any mayo left and if not I was going to bring some home because she volunteered me to cook burgers for our relatives. I got the ""what do you want from me"" two open palms in the air expression and the an eye roll. Then she says, ""Do I look like the fridge?"" This is just one example. A few days back she told me to get the pacifier that was the couch where everybody sits on their butts and is covered in cat hair. I took an extra 5 seconds to check the mouth piece against the light to make sure there's no cat hair, and she got SO MAD and said I'm too slow and wasting time, and I'm of no use to her. She micromanages and snaps at me for every little transgression. I've tried to plan date nights, bring date nights home, bring her flowers, and all were met by ""What the hell is all this crap, I don't have time for this nonsense. Leave me alone!""

I'm sorry I'm whining so much and I'm starting to type a lot because I'm getting my frustrations out. My buddy who has a kid a few months ahead of mine says he's going through the same thing, that his wife has mellowed out a little bit, but they're still not doing well. My neighbor who ALSO just had a kid randomly told me how he's thinking about leaving his wife because she's become so unmanageable. Is this a universal thing? Is this permanent? How long is it going to last? I still love her very much, and she herself has never mentioned breaking up, but she sure acts like she wants to be a single parent.

Edit: I really didn't expect to get this many responses. I enjoy them all both positive and negative because the broader the spectrum of opinions, the broader my own spectrum becomes. TBH, I feel relieved because I've been stressing that this is an isolated incident. It seems like all the couples around me (via social media) are just living in bliss with their kids while my own  home life is spiraling out of control. But now it seems like...well this brand of f\*cked up is par for the course, and I don't feel so alone. In fact, I feel a surge of confidence. I can't say I'll go talk to my wife about this because at the moment she's not a very good communicator, but I think I'm going to stop feeling so sorry for myself, tighten my belt, and suck it up. This  thing is CRAZY but it's a lot of fun, and looking at my kid's smiling face I instantly forget all my grief. Thanks everyone for weighing in. We're all doing our best a some encouragement and alternative points of view always helps. Be well and stay safe!",1

1964,"My [29F] ""friend"" [30M] won't leave me alone after asking for pictures Hi, 

I have an ex-friend that basically asked me for butt pictures (""May you do a spin? May I see it from the back?"" May you turn around?"" -- actual quotes) . I said no, pointed out I'm married and said he was making me feel uncomfortable. 

I quit talking to him so he went to my Etsy store, bought some items, wrote a message in the personalization box asking me to forgive him and then demanded a refund. I refunded him and told him I don't want to talk. 

I haven't blocked him yet and he will still message asking how I am, ask me not to be mad at him, etc. and I don't know if I should just block or if I should explain to him again why I am done. What do you think?",0
1126,"Kid doesn’t care that his favourite pet was killed by the dogs? Is that odd? We have a few hens. Two we hatched and raised from day 1. My 5yo is animal mad, he loves learning about them and taking care of his hens, dogs, horse and a small flock of sheep. He was particularly obsessed with one chicken, he’d kiss it, keep it treats &amp; talk about it all the time. He trained it to sit on his arm and FaceTimed it when we went on holidays.  

Earlier today that hen was mauled by the dogs. He found what was left of his chicken, just it’s head, neck and one foot, plus the very bloodied dogs.

He didn’t seem to care. He cried for about 8 seconds but I think that was mostly because I expected him too and said it’s ok to cry and be sad. But he mostly just said things like “we still have another chicken.” He understands death as his great grandad died two years ago (he still mentions him) and we’ve lost two hens in the past to old age. 

Is that a ‘normal’ reaction? Is it possible that losing the others has made him think they’re ‘disposable’? I’m very worried! 

TLDR: my kid doesn’t seem to care that the chicken he adored was ripped apart by the dogs",1
1152,"Reading. . . Hi everyone. My daughter is 6 and just started first grade. She gets really frustrated when reading. All of her kindergarten books she has memorized so we've been picking up books from the library which are a little more difficult. She likes to guess words or look at me instead of trying. Maybe that's normal, but I feel awful at times about how hard she struggles.

We're going to be trying new ways to make it fun. Example, we have a reading bingo game. I also created a treasure box when she wins the games.

We're going to sprinkle in some easier books with the level 1 books from the library, but all of the level 1 books are different depending on the book brand. The books from school are a whole other level system, and I can't seem to find similar books at the library. It's either too easy or too difficult. It's sort of frustrating.

I just wanted to check and see if anyone had recommendations on making it more fun or books we can try.

Thank you.",1
2767,"Mentally ill boyfriend not working leaving me with all expenses TW SUICIDE


I (23F) have been with my BF (22M) for 5 years. We just moved in together in may. In June he attempted suicide, we agreed that he would take some time off work, go on medical leave and attend therapy etc. And he did. BUT, despite his limited funds he was still ordering food to takeout Atleast 3x a week. While yet paying me a dime. I was paying for everything. Weed, groceries, utilities, rent and entertainment. I thought this was fine because he was struggling mentally and I wanted to help. 

A few weeks ago things started getting better. He eventually paid me one months rent. Though an extra month was missing (not to mention EVERYTHING else). He decided he wanted to go back to work. Which he was supposed to do yesterday. He didn’t go. Didnt call in. Nothing. 

2 days before he was supposed to go to work he left up on his computer that he was googling “easy ways to kill myself”. I confronted him, he reassured me he is OK. 

He disclosed to me yesterday he thinks he’s going to quit his job, apply for unemployment (which he cannot do till September 8 due to his doctor being on vacation), and start looking for a new job closer to where we will be moving (we are moving next month). 

He has stopped going to therapy, and is still ordering out despite his dwindling funds. I work 2 job and I am EXHAUSTED. I rarely buy anything for myself.

What do I do? I love hIM very much and want to see him better, but this constant financial burden is insane. I asked him to keep working until he secured a new job and he said he’d rather kill himself. I have talked to his parents and they said they will let him live there. Is this a fair decision. Someone help. 

TLDR; my (F23) mentally ill BF (M22) hasn’t been to work in months and hasn’t been contributing financially",0
3233,"My 50 year old aunt accuses my toddler of being a sexual deviant I (30f), am a single mother to twins. Their father passed away. They never met him. My kids are 4. Let's call my daughter Carmen and my son Sheldon. 

When Sheldon was 2 he was diagnosed with autism. I know some people may think that age is a bit early to tell but by then, differences between his and my daughter's development (and the other children surrounding us) had become glaringly obvious. I had my suspicions that something was not quite right when I brought him home from the hospital and it seemed like he was responding to my voice.  I thought he might have had a hearing problem after the first 2 months, but then he'd scream his little head off if I ever stopped singing. I realized then his hearing was fine. 
 After a few more obvious signs (lost speech, increased sensitivity to food and noise sensitivity), set up an appointment with a specialist and had both he and Carmen evaluated. They said he appeared to be high functioning, but as he was only 2 at the time of his evaluation, they couldn't completely determine his speech skills yet. Carmen they said, did show some symptoms of OCD, but it was hard to tell because girls are a bit harder to diagnose and because they were 2. She appeared normal though, If not gifted. 
After I received the results on both of them, I was able to breathe a sigh of relief. I finally knew what was going on with my kids and what steps to take next to assist them. A lot of my family members were against me getting them tested. They launched cliches phrases at me time and time again. ""He could still grow out of it."" ""You're gonna let everyone know he's crazy."" ""My friend's sister's son was just like him. He just need a good spanking."" ""You're just spoiling him too much, he's fine""

Shortly after that though we were able to move islands so that he would be able to attend to a school that could accommodate not his and my daughter's needs. Even more shortly after that however, we were caught in one of the worst storm in recorded history. The whole experience was pretty brutal and ended up with a bruised back and a broken foot and but I was able to get my kids, my diabetic mother, and myself through it unharmed...not counting my injuries, that is. After we managed to get evacuated off the island, they took us to our country's capital that hadn't been affected at all but we were there with thousands of other refugees from the storm. Also I was injured. Luckily for us though, my friend, some of whom I hadn't seen in years stepped up and took care of us and by the time my foot and back healed well enough for me to stand without monumental pain, I went to work. And began taking care of my family on my own. We were in the capital for two years And I was finally able to scrape together enough (thanks to new travel conditions enforced by the global situation), to get us back to our hometown, which was the other island horribly affected by the storm.

We've been here for 3 weeks, back in my childhood home, and it's been hell, and for several reasons. 
1. I'm not working. And I spent nearly I had saved just leaving the capital. 2. There are jobs available, but if you don't know the right person, its hard to get one. 3. We're now forced to cohabitate with my mom's younger sister, whom is a nurse and a Frontline worker in everything that's going on, but she's also a religious nutjob, an antivaccine spokesperson, not to mention, raging bitch that used to abuse me when I was a child and she didn't stop until I got fed up enough to hit her back and beat her up. 

And now the bitch has crossed the line. She's began to target my child. 
Sheldon, like all little boys, touches himself. All of my friends sons do this. All of my friends sons are neurotypical. My nephew does this. My little cousins do this. It's not a constant thing. And I think it's pretty common knowledge in this day and age, that kids touch their own privates. It's natural. And it's not like he's grabbing his stuff and going to town constantly he'll literally touch it as of he's checking to see if it's still there. Which he might be. It seemed to forget he had it when he was younger and would be shocked to find it every time he took a bath.

At first she said, he must have an infection, since he keeps grabbing it, we should have him circumcised. Nope. He doesn't have an infection Aunt bitch. He's just a little boy. Then she thinks something is wrong is with him and he's got an old man's spirit while my daughter has the spirit of a child. He's too aggressive. Yes, aunt bitch, autistic children have been known to become aggressive. Particularly when they've had their routine disrupted in major ways. We've just moved islands. Then we're making excuses for his behavior. He understands perfectly well what he's doing. We need to discipline him more. Yes aunt bitch discipline is important, but I'm not going to punish my child for simple things like not listening the first time I tell him to do something when the whole thing about his autism is he has an issue with communicating with others.

The thing is, she's swears she this expert on autistic children and kids in general, but she doesn't even have any children. 

Anyways, because of limited space, my mom and my kids end up sharing a bed with her. I take the floor. My son would sleep next to her because he rolls off the bed easily but last night she woke my mother up shouting about needing to watch my son. He tends to wiggle in his sleep when he has to use the bathroom, so my mom woke him and sent him to the use the potty. All the while she was screeching about needing to watch what my son does. Accusing that he was doing something dirty by touching myself while he slept and squirming because he had to go to the bathroom. My mother thanks heavens that I didn't wake up because I probably would have decked her.  
When she got home later from her shift at the hospital her story had changed. Apparently now when she woke up she saw my son sitting up in bed, touching himself and gyrating with his eyes rolling back into his head. In a dark room. Yeah I'm in that same room. No way. 
And even if that was the case, she seemed to have forget my mom was there too. And also would have seen. My son was laying against her when she woke up. He just was squirming because he had to potty. That's what my mom said. 
Now tell me what's more likely. That my 4 year old is a sexual deviant that just so happened to be going to town on himself for the first time while laying between his grandmother and rabid grandaunt and got caught, only by grand aunt, OR that my son simply had to use the potty while he was asleep, and mean, bitter twisted old woman with a dirty mind freaked out because her own perverse mind scared her???

Before anyone gets on me for even being underthe same roof as this woman, especially after what happened to me as a kid, know that this was not a decision made easily. It was made out of desperation to survive. As stated earlier I am a single parent taking care of a family of 4(myself included). This has not been easy. Physically, mentally, or financially. Having kids is expensive. Taking care of my mom expensive and while I'm happy to do it, that doesn't negate the emotional drain or strain that puts on me. I'm super emotional right now and she's not a stable person to have a conversation with, let alone, a discussion. 
All of my instincts are screaming at me to confront her and get into her face about my son because what I think is so funny is that all this has happened, she hasn't approached me yet about this situation. Only my mother. She knows I don't take her crap. Even when I was young. I let her hit me, until I didn't. I was never intimidated by, or felt threatened by her. And now she's trying to do the same thing to my son. 
And I don't want to wait until she gets brave enough for her to turn her negative attentions to my daughter. How do I get through this, with as little shit until I can get out of this fuckery completely?",1

1894,"(NSFW) (20M) Idk what to feel ((19F)GF lied about virginity) So a little backstory:

My gf and I started dating our senior year of high school (approaching two years this October). We were both friends since 6th grade. Early in our relationship, we actually both talked to each other about our expectations for the relationship.

One of the topics, of course, was sex. We both agreed that we wanted to do *it* but after some time. I knew that she had been in a previous relationship (two, actually. The second one was very short-lived). I told her that I was a virgin but it didn't matter to me if she was, I guess it was more of a disclaimer to not have her expectations too high haha. She had told me that she was also a virgin and how it was a big deal to her, so she didn't want it to feel rushed in any way, which was perfectly fine to me.

So about 3 weeks into our relationship, she told me she was ready. I was still a little unsure, not no much for my sake, but hers. I didn't feel ready to take that from her since it seemed to mean so much to her. After expressing my feelings about that, she insisted she was ready and I was overthinking it.

Current day, we're just about to reach two years in our relationship. We've gone through about a month-long break and a few ups and downs. Right now is one of those down spots. I was talking to a couple of people I know about some of the things going on, half venting, half getting advice. I ended up learning from them, she had actually slept with both of her previous partners before me. Her not being a virgin wasn't a big deal to me, but lying about it was.

She's had a bunch of issues in the past lying about what seems like everything, things that don't even matter. I've had discussions with her about it, seeing if it's something about me that makes her uncomfortable with being open about certain things. It seems like we've made progress on it, but learning about her history did hit pretty hard.

I just have a hard time dealing with the fact that our relationship started off with a lie. Something I made sure she knew didn't matter, but she still lied. Another thing is that she ended up during our relationship saying how she felt pushed by me to lose her ""virginity"" when I was very reluctant and kept asking to make sure she was ready. Probably the biggest factor is that she had pushed me to try unprotected sex. If I had known she had previous partners (also during the time she was on birth control to help with period cramps), I probably would've been a little more reluctant due to disease and all that. But thinking I was her first and only, I didn't really think twice about it.

I haven't confronted her about it, I want to give it time in case I get too emotional asking her about it.

If there's anything unclear, lmk and I'll edit/respond to fix it.  Thanks, everybody!",0
2005,"Relationship Hello. I hope you are doing great. 

I am just here to ask for an advice. So I attend an unaccredited high school in California. We had a part time teacher that taught history twice a week. She was still really young like 20 when I was 17. She only worked at the school for 8 months. At a community event, I saw her again and got her number. She relocated to a really far state. After her relocation, I started talking to her. We have been talking for months now, we both fell in love with each other. Is this legal? We are only three years apart but I am younger than 18. She is still not 21 yet. 
Also is this socially acceptable? She only taught us for a short time and she is not actually a teacher. She is applying to a whole different program. 

I am graduating high school this year, I work to support my family. I am very mature and she is too. She is the happiness of my life. Before I met her, I had literally no source of happiness. She is the best thing that happened to me.

3066,"Clingy ex obsessed with me Hi everyone, I kindly ask you to not judge please but i need help. background info: I’m a very non confrontational, shy person. I have anxiety and have trouble saying no to people. 
Sorry for the long post, frustration has been building up inside me and I really want advice.

I (F21) met this person (27M) more than a year ago and he immediately tried to start something with me. I didn’t want a relationship at the time and I told him that but he continued talking to me as friends. Eventually, we started “dating” and this went on for months. I knew from the first couple months that it wasn’t going to work out, and I kept telling him that but he continued to convince me to stay with him. We are very different and to be quite honest I wasn’t very attracted to him to begin with (not just physically, but with regards to personality, everything.) 
The first time I tried to break up with him was 2 months in, because I knew it would be unfair to him to lead him on. I tried and it didn’t go well, he cried and begged me to stay with him. It was incredibly hard for me to actually say no but i refused. After the breakup he started texting me as if nothing m happened and begged that we stay together so I gave in. Since then, the same exact thing happened around 4-5 times: I try to break up with him, he cries and refuses to break up so we stay together. 

A few months ago, I finally broke up with him and refused to back down, and he thankfully finally accepted it. The problem is he is so madly in love and obsessed with me that the final breakup really hurt him. He BEGGED for us to remain friends as it would “help him move on and not be depressed”. I agreed because I felt so bad about breaking his heart but now I realize it was a mistake. He is so extremely clingy it gets on my nerves; he still tries to use relationshipy phrases, texts me all the time, doesn’t get any of the hints, and is SOOO obsessed with me I hate it. It’s getting to the point where I can’t even stand him and I feel disgust/annoyed by everything he does. 
For the record, he’s the nicest guy ever, obsessed with making me happy and is there for me all the time. I’m just sick of him and his clingyness and personality and jokes and everything. Hanging out with him feels like a chore and im tired of of pretending to enjoy it. He also keeps sending me shirtless pictures, wanting to initiate sexual acts and giving me his hoodies to wear even though I never ask for any of it. 

TLDR: please advise me on how I can make my clingy ex understand that I don’t want a relationship (or even a friendship at this point) with him. He still loves me and I don’t want to hurt him but I am so over him at this point!!!",0
2414,"My boyfriend is still ""in love"" with his deceased girlfriend I don't even know where to start with this one. Even typing this out feels selfish and wrong. Me (21f) and my boyfriend (26m) have been together for a little under two years. I love him more than anything, but I don't even know if I should be with him. About three days ago, we were having a conversation about how people will still love their deceased past loves because they never had a chance to move on. Idk if I was wrong for this, but I said you can still love them but if you move on you're not in love with them. He corrected me and told me he was still in love with his deceased girlfriend and that if I couldn't accept it we should breakup. I'll admit I did get defensive and upset, but I didn't yell or cuss. Now it's three days later and idk how to move on. Ig what I'm asking is, what should I do? I love him but idk if I can  be with him.

1322,Don’t have fucking child So yeah basically don’t have kids if you aren’t going to be helpful during the emotional times. I’ve felt as a kid depressed obviously I didn’t know what it was as a child I just wanted to spend the day crying because that’s just how I felt still do but the reason why I say don’t have kids is because I remember my parents calling me a crybaby or saying I’m too sensitive that I can’t even be looked at without getting mad(partly true) but even since a kid I wasn’t able to properly regulate my emotions still can’t and now I’m in my own crisis trying to figure out who I am. It seems like everyone thinks I’m just a fucking cry baby and that’s why I’ve gotten angry and there’s deep resentment and anger towards my parents because they truly fucked my mentality and never actually taught me that my emotions are valid and instead criticize me and be little me.

Well everybody got sick so I rightfully kept them home. Now My youngest has been home for 6 days now his teacher is telling me to get a note from the doctor because he’s been gone too many days.

We had a $50 on a boxing event a couple days ago (the Jake Paul fight) and we shook on it. I sent him a $50 Venmo request before the fight as a way to talk trash. The guy I bet on ended up winning. After the match ended, I jokingly trash talked to him (we always do this when one of us is rooting for another guy who loses). I half-jokingly told him I’d take that $50. He was pretty salty about it and didn’t respond. The next day he snapchatted me normally just like he does every other day. I messaged him back and said something like “friendly reminder we had a $50 bet on the Jake Paul fight” and he didn’t respond.  

We don’t bet on sports a lot, but we did a couple months ago on a Ufc fight. I lost the bet and Venmo’d him $25 right after the fight ended and I would have sent him money if my guy lost this time.

791,"TIFU by being disorganized, forgetful, and not prioritizing family I had tickets for the Green Day Hella Mega tour, and I just realized I missed the concert. :( I was going to take my son--the tickets were my birthday gift to him, which I bought over a year and a half ago. This would have been his first concert, and I was so proud to have gotten him something that would have been such a great experience. I'm devastated. I'm so upset with myself because we were both looking forward to the concert after it had been rescheduled last year due to COVID; and after such a shitty year for him personally and academically, he really needed this. I didn't miss it by a little, either. It was two weeks ago. But by that time it had become such a seemingly distant thing, I had even started thinking it was in September. :(


There's this disconnect that happens with me sometimes that's so frustrating. I *was* genuinely looking forward to this concert--we both were--but I didn't muster up the discipline to simply check the date. Obviously, he forgot, too, but he relies on me to remember the shit that I'm in charge of. I just received a bill today for a missed appointment for my son, too. My poor time management is just sapping me. People at work had been asking, when are you going to take a vacation? But I always felt too busy to take one. Yet recently I've had an increasing sense of failure in not having made any special plans for or with my son this summer--so finally, I just took the last few days before school starts again to relax and do some shopping with him. But this really takes the wind out of my sails. I'll have to tell him in the morning, and I don't know how I'll make up for it.",1

We went camping and took a potty training break (as we’ve done every few weeks when things really regress). How do I proceed here? She’s not the type to get motivated by presents or candy or whatever. It’s going to be an emotional availability issue. Do I stop with potty and move to paci? Hold off on both to see how school goes?

2007,"Siblings (and I) considering going NC with parents [UPDATE] Im on mobile and don't understand linking things, original post is first post on my profile. Soz. TLDR at bottom. ✌

It's been about 2 months since original. Thanks to the few who commented on the original post, things have happened since then.

That morning emotions were running high, as they tend to do when our parents are involved. After a few days I made my decision. I managed to get younger sibling on the phone and told them that I wasn't comfortable/ready to have a direct confrontation, but if they wanted me around for them to do one then I'd be more than happy to lend my support. (Ended up having to tell the older via text cause I couldn't get them on a call.) Both were appreciative of my directness and willingness to still support what they wanted, and respectful of my decision.

 If a confrontation did happen during the visit, I was never aware of it. I doubt one ended up happening.

However, older and I have been trying to help younger disengage with the parents; I've also been making a point to avoid spending time with them (something mother picked up on briefly, but I smoothed over bc I'm good at that). 

During the visit my partner helped me see that I became increasingly anxious, and often read into their usual jokes/statements over-critically and would become defensive. So yeah, time spent with my parents is bad for mental health. Noted.

On a high note, I'm starting some self-help therapy to get me started, beginning with ""Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Adults"" by Lindsay C Gibson. Soon to be followed by ""Self Care for [same title]"". I'm in chapter 2 and have to be careful how much I read, due to becoming emotionally raw/exposed. Partner is proud of me, and that alone makes it worth it at the moment.

TLDR: random internet strangers were right, none of us confronted but are all quietly going low contact. I'm starting self-help books til I have enough for proper therapy.

Side note: I proposed to my partner while siblings were in town. Was a beautiful moment for the four of us. 10/10 would do again ❤",0
2823,"in a really weird break up situation i don’t rly know who to talk to bc i’m in such a weird situation and i don’t even know if i need advice or if what i simply need is for me to be heard. ok. so. 
My boyfriend and I have been dating 2 years, living together 7 months. after moving we started having some problems which we just chalked up to getting use to our very different living styles. it’s both of our first times living on our own. there’s a long story to this but basically after a disagreement (which i call it that bc we never rly have fights, we always handle things very civilly and respectfully) we revealed to each other that we both had the feeling that we knew we wouldn’t end up staying together in the long run. we both pictured ourselves with someone else in the future, but that we were happy w each other at the moment. We both have different wants/needs/ideas on how relationships work. Typically i’m the one that over analyzes/overthinks, but i was currently rly happy in the relationship and didn’t want these scary thoughts of the future affecting my daily life. we keep living life for a few weeks, everything seems really Really good to me, like better than normal. Then he comes to me the other day saying how he just can’t stop thinking about the inevitable, he’s still so in love with me but there’s a lot of things that we  fundamentally disagree w about how relationships should function and that he thinks we should break up. That was a really shitty night. i had been sick that day, throwing up, he got home from work and we had plans to go bowling w friends and he asked if he could still go. i didn’t have a problem w it but asked if he would come home early bc i rly didn’t feel like being alone all night and he said he would. he didn’t come home until midnight. and that’s when he said it. 

Now the past few days have been really fucking weird. we still are very much in love and attached to each other but know our relationship is doomed. the past few days have been like oddly pretty good, we’ve been spending a lot of time close together, and at night have deep discussion about what this all means. We decided to “ease” out of the relationship, i guess just because of how much this situation kinda sucks.  i’m gonna start looking for apartments and live on my own, which is something i’ve always wanted to do, but it sucks bc i feel like i’m being pushed into this when i’m not ready. I’m terrified that my feelings for him won’t go away and i’m gonna have to watch his fade. he’s my best friend and we promised each other we’ll stay in our lives. I have no idea how to tell my parents, they really love him and think everything is perfect, but i have to tell them soon bc i need someone to co-sign a lease for me. 
He says i can stay living here as long as i need to. we’re still sleeping in the same bed and pretty much acting like we’re still in a relationship. and it’s driving me INSANE. if we’re not gonna be together why are we doing this to ourselves but I DONT WANNA BREAK UP but i don’t want him to have to stay in a relationship he doesn’t want to be in. i’m so confused and have no idea what’s going on nothing feels real",0

Normally from a girl’s pictures, I can tell if they simply wear makeup as a hobby/daily choice, or if they wear it for special events. This girl definitely seems like the special event type, so I feel like I could mention that she doesn’t have to “get all dolled up” for our first date.

Typing this out, I don’t feel like I’m coming off as genuine. But I’m just more attracted to women without makeup. If she wears makeup, it won’t be a deal breaker. Or even a huge problem at all. Natural faces are just more appealing to look at. I also find myself not wanting to touch/kiss a face that has makeup on it. Because at the end of the day, it’s art, and I feel like I’ll mess it up.

2902,"From which stage can we say we've been dating? So my boyfriend and I met right at the start of 2019, and almost immediately started acting like a couple. (although he wasn't exclusive for another 6 months). We would talk every day, stay at each other's places every week etc. 

After we became exclusive I just kind of assumed that we are in a relationship. Like everything about us and everything we did suggested we were dating, almost like an old married couple.

Then we broke up for a couple months just before covid hit in March, then got back together and made it official June 2020. Been living together since then.

So when a conversation came up about how long we've been together, I said 2.5 years. He said no, only 1 year, because apparently until we made it official it doesn't count??? Like wtf? Ok, I can understand if they asked how long you've been 'officially' dating, I would say a year, but been together for 1.5 years before that.

I just hate the thought that even if we weren't official, that 1.5 years was still meaningful. I understand that yes, because he wasn't exclusive with me at first, that was still the start of something. But even from the time we became exclusive apparently doesn't count either.

Since classes have started these jokes have become more frequent and have shifted to her saying things along the lines of “you need to gain the freshman fifteen” and “I want you to gain weight.” For reference my body weight is slightly under average for my height, but I am still healthy.

98,"Well-checks in the morning only!! Why do pediatrician near me only schedule well-checks in the morning?  It literally makes no sense to do sick calls in the afternoon. If your child is sick then you have to be off work and they can't go to daycare or school. If you're child is not sick and is coming for a well-check then they can go to school/daycare and the parents can work. Forcing parents to take off work for a well-check is terribly short-sighted and in complete disregard of working parents. Women are still the primary parents who bring children to appointments (likely due to lower wage jobs) and forcing moms to lose time at work for non-emergency appointments contributes to a culture where women are mommy-tracked and lose respect in the workplace by being unreliable. Also, it creates a system where my PTO is used for non-emergency appointments leaving little space for actually enjoyable time off (when you include sick time as well).",1
2566,"I have an allegation that is false and I’m scared it will ruin my future relationships.. 
As the title says I have an allegation from a former best friend. in today’s climate it’s valid to always believe the accuser wich is totally fine by me and myself always takes an accusers side. To add though I am posting from an anonymous account, that in mind I have no reason to lie about the claim. 

So to provide a little backstory back in 2014 I was throwing my 15th birthday party I had my friends josh, his gf, Jessica, her gf, and me and my gf at the time. (All names changed) that night we all smoked a blunt I passed out first next to my girlfriend and Jessica and her girlfriend drank a whole bottle of absinth. My girlfriend is asleep on my left Jessica asleep on my right and jessica gf asleep on her right while Josh and his girlfriend were asleep across the room. 
The next day we all woke up hung out for a bit and then we all walked Jessica home.

fast forward to 2016 I am now living with Jessica and her brother. her brother and I are best friends but I was friends with Jessica first. I was basically treated like family me and Jessica would hang out with her friend Claire at the time and we would hang out every week together Claire was Jessica‘s best friend and Jessica set both of us up to date. Jessica and I got drunk together plenty of times would hang out multiple times and overall would just be best friends, I have text w her saying she misses me and that she wants to hang out etc. fast forward to 2017 me Jessica and her brother all move out and get a place together. And around this time she start dating my best friend Daniel and they get really close and all three of us start hanging out. Now we reach 2018. I hear from Jessica‘s brother out of nowhere that Jessica claims that I had my hand on her lap when we were sleeping back in 2014. Confused and thrown off I go and ask Jessica about the claim. Basically saying I don’t recall such a thing happening and that it could’ve been her girlfriend instead? But overall I’m sorry if that did happened and I apologize if it made her uncomfortable but I wanted to reiterate that I wasn’t conscious and I don’t think I did that (without coming off disrespectful.) I kind of gave benefit of the doubt that may be in my sleep I rolled over thinking it was my girlfriend or my hand could’ve just laid there. Overall though made me feel kind of weird and confused.

Fast forward a year later I’m living with daniel at his moms which is also Jessica‘s boyfriend and we are hanging out every single day basically taking time away from Jessica. And out of nowhere my best friend starts beefing with me and kicks me out. And come to find out Jessica was now saying that I fingered her in her sleep... I heard this from her brother and it was complete shock to me because of so many reasons. One, why did the story change? Second, I personally have been raped and I for sure wouldn’t hang out with my rapist, Get drunk with them alone.let alone live with them or hook my best friend up with them..So that was confusing. And three, i’ve never cheated in my whole life and why would I do something so risky where my girlfriend is right by me and her girlfriends right by her? and I know this is going to come off kind of like victim shaming. But it is a genuine question, if I was asleep or not why didn’t she stop me? And you can say because she was nervous or whatever but that brings me back to “why did the story change?” Now I never got an answer to her perspective if I was awake or not. Because in my perspective I went to bed and I woke up and we hung out for a bit and took her home. But I know for a fact I can’t finger somebody if I am asleep, and I think that is the reason why she never answered me when I asked if I was awake or asleep because I feel like she knew it might poke some holes in her alligation. And so I talk to her brother about it and he was also very confused about the situation too and at first wasn’t believing anything. He was telling me that she has a history of being kind of a compulsive liar and kind of skeemy, for example she made a fake account and was messaging her main account bullying herself and stuff like that. Jessica would claim it to be her boyfriends exes so people would stop being friends with that person so Jessica could have them as their friends. And if I’m going to be honest I feel like she brought that up because I was taking a lot of time away from her boyfriend. Give it about eight months and the three of us are cool again without really talking about it

Fast forward to 2020 I have a girlfriend and she is already aware of the alligation because I told her before Jessica could because I thought it would come better from my mouth than hers because I could let her know some backstory before she just got a random message. But this year her and I broke up and I was hanging out with Jessica and Daniel at their new place. they’re being there for me like what friends do during a break up. But once Jessica hears that I’m trying to go back out with my girlfriend that they don’t really like they start messaging my ex saying that I was feeling up on Jessica while she was asleep and taking advantage of her and that I’m trying to fuck other girls and basically just telling my fresh ex a bunch of things that would definitely make her not want to go back out with me but Jessica had no clue that my ex already knew about the allegation. So whenever my ex heard about it she knew it didn’t add up to what I originally said and she told me about it and I know for a fact I didn’t touch up on Jessica boobs or anything like that like she all the sudden was claiming. And it really pissed me off because it is now the third time but I’m hearing about this alligation after I’ve already talk to them about it. So I go to my best friend Daniel on Snapchat and I say “hey we need to talk it’s serious” and he left me on read and a few days later I’m at the casino with our friend group Jessica and her boyfriend knows I am there and they show up, both of them acting best friends with me. I was amicable but I wasn’t really having it. And so the next day I message him again saying “we really need to talk” and I’m kind of upset that he was ignoring me. Anyway we get into a big fight and I had screenshot proof of messages that his girlfriend was saying things to my ex that involves him, that if I were to show him he would’ve understood that there are some lies being told. But I couldn’t show these to him because my ex didn’t want to get involved and she was the one that got sent the messages. But basically he was saying he knows that I did it because the girlfriend at the time (2014) was ugly I would’ve loved to touch up Jessica cause she had tits and mine didnt . And I hear from my fresh ex that Jessica was messaging her about the alligation. But Jessica didn’t know that me and my fresh ex still talked and when I told Jessica‘s boyfriend to stop telling everybody about this because it is slander and that we could talk about it because it is our Business. He then says they don’t tell anybody even though I had screenshots?

I haven’t talked to them since. I messaged Jessica‘s boyfriend trying to reach out so we don’t have any more beef. And at the moment I’m talking to a new girl that doesn’t know anybody or has any context and she is very “human rights” &amp; so am I, but I am scared to death that one day Jessica will pick up wind that I’m dating someone else and message her about the alligation. But I am also in a position where I can’t tell the new girl that I’m talking to about the situation because she might just see that as a red flag and stop talking to me… And I know in today’s age with a lot of legit accusations it’s a valid response to hearing allegations like that. But as God as my witness I didn’t do a single thing to Jessica and I never even had the thought of doing anything remotely close to that. At first I wanted to give benefit of the doubt to avoid any conflict because it did seem somewhat possible to have accidentally put my hand on her lap with my girlfriend on my left. But the first time the story changedI knew for sure there was absolutely no way I could’ve fingered her in my sleep because no matter what I wasn’t conscious because if I was conscious I would’ve remembered it and that would mean I would have to consciously do something to her. Again I have no reason to lie in this post because it is anonymous, with that being said I did not lay a hand on her whatsoever. And considering how the third time around her and her boyfriend were saying I was grabbing on her boobs and feeling her up while she was asleep? It kind of solidified for me that there was some sort of motive to ruin my life? Or they wanted something out of me? I’m not 100% sure. All I do know is we live together multiple times on multiple different occasions was best friends for years hung out with her on a weekly basis got drunk with her just her and I multiple times and she hooked me up with her best friend. She also text me she missed me and wanted to hang out I have it saved on Snapchat. And to me I know I would never do any of that with my sexual abuser.

So my main thing is. What should I do to avoid this? Do I reach out to them and try to make both parties feel somewhat satisfied with the situation so I don’t have to worry about her messaging any future girlfriends of mine? Or should I tell the girl I’m talking to now about the situation before Jessica tells her? Or should I just block everybody on Instagram that expressive Jessica and I hope to God it doesn’t get brought up? I don’t really know what to do in the situation… 

(TLDR; I had a birthday party in 2014 where girl accuse me of having my hand on her lap. And I didn’t hear about the accusation until 2018 and in between 2014 and 2018 I was living with her and her brother on multiple occasions I also got hooked up with her best friend from her. And On multiple occasions her and I got drunk 1 on 1. Fast forward to 2019 I hear from her brother which is my best friend that the alligation was all of a sudden changed to me fingering her when she was asleep. I then get kicked out by her boyfriend because I was living with her boyfriend which is also my best friend and then about nine months later her boyfriend and I become friends again and at this time I’m dating someone. My Gf knows about the allegation because I told her about it to prevent any drama. My girlfriend And I ended up breaking up this year but when my best friend and his girlfriend heard I was trying to go back out with my girlfriend at the time they didn’t like that and they started messaging my girlfriend at the time that I was feeling up on her boobs while she was asleep because the girlfriend that I had at the time (2014) didn’t have any. And the girl I was trying to go back out with already knew the original story and knew what she was being told wasn’t lining up. So basically the alligation story changed three different times and during all that we were living together and being best friends. I myself am a victim of sexual assault and none of the behaviors line up to what the allegation is because I would never live, hang out, set up a date, or get drunk with my rapist. Fast forward to the present day I’m talking to a new girl she has no clue about any of these people existing and I am scared to death that she is going to try to ruin my life and message any girl that I’m trying to date. So how should I go about this? I want to avoid anybody knowing about this that I am talking too.) - please read last paragraph ⬆️",0
3140,"Advice on dealing with circumstantial breakups My partner (20M) and I (21F) moved cities together a few years ago, we’ve been together three years. I’ve recently made the decision to move home again for a lot of reasons - not to do with our relationship. I think we would have continued to be together for a while, we haven’t had issues and work well together. Neither of us are willing to do long distance. Most of our friends are mutual and I’m close with his family (+ friends with their siblings). It’s not realistic to completely cut each other off, and neither of us really want to considering we’ve had a really lovely and communicative relationship. 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on making the breakup manageable for both of us, or experiences with similar situations. I really want to prevent a drawn out painful breakup, but I can imagine it’ll be hard for us to let go considering it’s circumstantial rather than todo with our relationship directly. 

Much appreciated


TLDR: breaking up because I’d like to move home and they want to stay",0
1952,"On a break and possibly ending our relationship...I'm lost My(23f) partner(27m) and I are currently taking a ""break"" to sort through our thoughts and feelings. We have been together for four years, living together for three. This is both of our first serious relationships. 

Several weeks ago, I expressed feelings I was having to my partner of a need to move to a larger city when I graduate, as it is something that I've thought about on and off for a while. Whether or not we would stay together should I move came up, and I really didn't know what I felt. He said he wouldn't want to move, and I wasn't sure how I felt about doing a long distance relationship. He suggested we take a few days apart to figure out our feelings, then talk. We did, and in those days I thought really hard about what I want long-term out of life. Our relationship has always been good. Not in a ""we never fight and we're obsessed with each other"" way, but in a way that we work well together, have fun together, and love each other a lot. In addition, I got realistic about city life and realized that career-wise, it wouldn't be a good idea for me. I told him all of this when we spoke, and made sure he knew that I know we have a good relationship, and I wasn't going to just give it up on the off-chance I might actually live my dreamed up life in a city. 

He said he believed me, although my previous uncertainty had left him a bit shaken, and he wanted to take things slowly going back in. So, we decided I would continue staying with my parents and we would talk every day and see each other when we could(I'm a full time student and work as well, so my schedule is very busy). This went on for several days, and we had discussed me coming home today. Well, he invited me over to talk this afternoon, and I thought we were going to discuss how we're going to move forward from this as a couple, but he sprung something completely different on me. 

He said that he's enjoyed being alone. He's struggled with mental health for a long time, and says he's just now in the last couple months started to really come to a good place with it. I mentioned last week that I thought my parents didn't know him like I did, and didn't know the real him. He told me this made him think about things, and he says he feels like he doesn't know himself. I understand this. He wants to take an extended break(we didn't define this really, just said a few weeks), this time without talking or seeing each other, to sort through these feelings and decide whether or not he can do this while in a serious relationship. He told me that if I didn't want to wait for him to sort through it, he would understand if I just wanted to make it a clean break. 

I know what this sounds like, that he just wants out of the relationship and doesn't want to seem like an asshole. Truly, I know this is breaking his heart. He was incredibly emotional throughout our conversation today, and I know it was genuine. 

I am completely lost in this situation. Is taking this longer break just prolonging an inevitable break up? If he wants to continue our relationship, will these feelings he's having just resurface? Do I need time alone? Should I spend some time to find myself as an adult? Seriously any advice or comfort or just similar situations you've been through would be such a help right now. He's the only one in my life that I would feel comfortable being totally open and vulnerable with, so I'm feeling very alone.",0
1147,"Daughter went off to college last week. Haven’t heard from her So, we sent our daughter off to college last week. She has been in contact multiple times each day with her mom, my wife. Me? Not at all. I texted her to see how things are going. No respons.

To be fair, my daughter was always closer to her mom. But she doesn’t want any communication with me at all now that she’s in college? It’s hard not to take this personally and to be profoundly sad.

1016,"How do I get my 2 year old to start brushing? My 2yo daughter has some sort of tooth decay in her front four teeth, she initially had it in one spot but over two days, it spread to all four front teeth. 

I'm not sure how that happened, but the dentist said this is common and will get better by itself. He's asked me to brush her teeth. 

I tried to introduce brushing her teeth earlier but my MIL force-cleaned her teeth once and now she refuses to even let the brush anywhere near her teeth. I'm trying to get her to watch while I brush my own teeth but she refuses to watch, doesn't let me brush either. 

What I wanna ask is: 
1. Has this decay thing happened to somebody's kids? How did you manage it? 
2. How do I get my daughter to brush her teeth..? I think she's traumatized by the experience with my MIL, I just don't know how to manage this. 

Any advice is appreciated.

1958,"My boyfriend admitted he doesn't trust me. My (24f) boyfriend (25m) of over a year has gotten progressively more suspicious of everything that I do. He had previously been getting upset if I were to go to Walmart or the dollar store while he was at work without telling him beforehand, no matter what I was buying. Even if I told him immediately after he got home from work. He tried to get upset with me for wanting to hang out with my friend in downtown city so I told him he was welcome to come with but then he complained it was too far of a drive (1hr) and that he had work in the morning. So then I suggested I go to see my friend that I hadn't seen in weeks by myself, and it turned into such a big deal that I ended up not going and we got into a huge fight about it. I was out of work for a few months, so I asked him if he'd be comfortable with me getting a job with him (at a sand mine) and he said it would probably cause too much drama. Okay, sure. So I told him I was going to start working at a bank, and he complained I would have to dress too nicely and customers would hit on me. Well the bank job didn't work out anyways. I then found an opportunity as a general manager at a local auto parts store and he got upset because I would be working in a male dominated field, even though I would be running a store with more female employees than males. I haven't heard back from that job just yet so I started working for my childhood neighbor's construction company. He's started asking me every day who I was working with, where I was working and what I was doing. I've obliged but I'm obviously questioning where this was coming from. We have been talking about what's going on and he's told me he doesn't trust me. He's been going through my phone and asking me every day if so and so has been flirting with me or if he's got to ""worry"" about so and so etc. We have had several discussions about the trust issue since and he chocks it up to his previous girlfriends cheating and screwing him over, and his friends girlfriends doing the same. What can I do here? I am not guilty of anything unfaithful. He's been asking me if I would marry him, and he says he loves me etc. But I'm wondering how true this is if he really can't trust me. Our relationship has been so beautiful up to this point, and he has been so caring and kind outside of this but I feel we're growing farther apart. Our discussion got a little deeper tonight because I told him it probably wouldn't be a good idea to try to marry a woman you admit that you can't trust, and he responded with ""it sounds to me like I just shouldn't be in a relationship at all"" and has now avoided talking to me for 2 hours. Is there anything I or we could do? I love him and outside of this trust issue I could be happy with him but I refuse to just obey and allow him to control and disrespect me like this.

He and his ex-SIL will hug and kiss each other. Not kiss each other on the mouth, but multiple kisses on the cheeks and forehead. He doesn’t do this with anyone else, other than me. 

Recently after she got upset over something, he “comforted” her by giving her a big hug, grabbing her face and kissing her on the face multiple times - but never on the lips. In their defense, she was upset over something- but she tends to lean on him for emotional support a lot. 

He will also hug her from behind. They do this right in front of me. 

When I got upset, it turned into a big argument. But, it wasn’t the best time to have that talk because we had both been drinking.

1060,"41 Weeks Infant Struggling with Feeding Hi r/,  


I would like to emphasize first that my wife and I are not looking for medical advice. We are just looking to hear about feeding tips and see if other parents have been through this situation before.  


Ou daughter was born prematurely at 37 weeks. My wife is a type 1 diabetic who kept her blood glucose levels near non-diabetic levels throughout the pregnancy. Due a preeclampsia, my wife had a c-section. She had RDS when she was born and had to be intubated for 2 days, and from day 3 to day 30 at NICU she wrong from high-flow oxygen to low-flow and eventually her SO2 levels were perfect and off the oxygen she goes. During this how time she had feeding tube placed in her nose, and she still has it.  


The reason why she was in NICU for so long came down to her feeding. Some days she took the bottle great, taking 50-60ml a few times a day. Some days she took 20-40ml, and some days she would not even wake up for her feeds. We were on a strict 3 in 3 hours , 70-115ml (towards the end of our NICU stay) schedule. Our daughter was born at 9lbs 14oz, and she's currently 11lbs, so clearly a bigger baby.  


We were able to bring her home Sunday, August 22nd. We were told that it's normal to take a few days for babies to adjust to their new environment and their behaviour may be different than what we were used to. The first couple days were brutal, she was not interested in eating at all and we had to feed her through her tube ( We were sent home with a pump and kangaroo bags). Today, we thought we had a breakthrough with her taking 60ml for one feed and later 25ml on the other feed. This recent feed she would not wake up for it.  


We kept being told that babies from diabetic mother (type-1), are ""lazier"" and it takes them a while to ""snap out of it"".  


Has any parent went through a similar situation, that could have any tips on how to get her more interested in feeding? Maybe different feeding technics? If you went through the same situation, how long it took for your child to ""snap out of it"" ? We understand each baby is different, but for our sanity it would be nice to have an idea about what other parents gone through.  


Some other points:

* We are currently using a Dr.Browns bottle with a premie nipple
* We noticed she also swallows a lot of air during feeding
* We had a genetic testing done at around 16-20weeks of gestation that rolled out most genetic conditions
* Doctor could not find anything wrong with her during our NICU stay, other than ""babies from diabetic mother's are often lazy""
* She was taking more ml per feed at NICU rather than at home.",1

So I currently have my friend over and he was making him and I a tea, once done he walks over to hand it me. I’m positioned next to my girlfriend and he is coming from my girlfriends side and there is also a table in front. So I lean over to grab it by the top of the cup. Probably not the best thing to do but I wasn’t aware that this tea was extremely full, I spill a little and my girlfriend makes a deal out of it and as this is happening my fingers are beginning to burn a bit beyond comfort. So I make haste to put this damn cup down, as I am my girlfriend is screaming for me to put it on the plate, I didn’t notice this because of my fingers and I wasn’t able to bring it down clickly because my girlfriend had her hands under it so I had to avoid that. Anyways the cup comes down my hands hurt a little spilt but no big deal, but not on the plate… she hits me almost immediately in my back, I have pretty bad acne that side so it hurts a little. She’s yelling about the plate and I’m trying to calm her down, trying to explain how my fingers where burning and I didn’t see the plate I just saw where I could put it down.

When he is over my chest with his little hands and arms or face touching my ribs/chest it gives me beautiful feelings inside. I believe that's some hormones rising.

1264,"Too much time with ""negative"" grandparents? Hi all, this could almost be a relationship advice post but I really was hoping for parents to weigh in on the situation.

Background: I moved far from my family to be with my husband. His (retired) parents moved near us as soon as we had kids. Have a 3YO and &lt;1YO. MIL is a justno MIL, in the sense that she gets frequently angry and starts fights about our 'behavior', she is the mother and we are the children who should obey, boundary stomping, loves criticizing waiters at restaurants and being the ""big bad"" one who tells her opinion, etc. My husband has apologized to me numerous times for having to put up with them (so, he sees them as being very difficult too). Also they have honestly told us they want to cut all ties with us 3 times during big fights, and use everything they can against us in a fight (like, oh we watched your kids but aren't good enough to do x and y?). They are toxic.

I do think they completely love my first and would never intentionally harm him. However, call it stupidity or ignorance but they have done tons of things that either broke our rules or just were stupid (like offering my 4MO chocolate pudding!)

We see them at least once a week for a visit, at least a couple hours with a coffee or meal tied in.  On top of that my husband will occasionally go alone with my oldest so he is ""entertained"".  Now that the younger one is getting more independent, SO and i have talked about switching off nights where one has both kids and the other can have personal time.  

Here's my problem. My husband tells me, when he has the kids he will just bring them to his parents. I said it wasn't fair, because my parents aren't near by. He says, it's my own fault if i choose not to spend the extra time with MIL (which is for me pure stress) to have some ""help"" with the toddler, and it's none of my business how he spends his time alone w the kids. 

I really REALLY don't want my kids spending so much time with them. They are loved, but my in laws yell, get in arguments, and are just unhappy mean old people in general and i just don't want them having such a big influence from them.

My marriage has other issues but I needed a sanity check. My 4 y.o. has a hitting problem when it comes to me, his grandma and less so his Mom. I find my wife to be to permissive that has led to a LOT of friction. 

We had a blow up today because my child wanted to use a massage ball after I picked it up and was about to use it. I said he can have it after I am done. He did him mini tantrum and swung. It's not his all but he is demonstrating bad behavior and I want to nip it in the bud. I said he cannot hit and he has to use his words. He tried again and I said stop it and see are gonna doa time out and talk about it. He then pivots and wants his truck toy. I take the truck and say we are doing a time out for 2 min and no toys. My wife who swoops in at this point picks him up hugs him wants to know what is going on. I explain the situation and she kisses him says don't hit daddy and then motions to give him back the toy. I say that we have not done timeout yet and he did not apologize or acknowledge anything yet and we need that piece. She then sort of leads him to say sorry and the she is like ""see?""

When we first met, I thought he was a really extroverted and positive person which is what attracted me to him, and he has so many friends I can barely keep track of them. But as I got to know him better, I started to learn that he was actually deeply insecure, pessimistic and sensitive. At first, I thought this was normal and entered the relationship thinking this was a problem we could work through - I myself am quite a negative person, but I usually keep my concerns to myself and work through them on my own and in my own time, plus I’m not very emotional so I usually rationalise my problems. So I started to find it very challenging when he started to express his negative emotions to me very regularly, often about things I felt were quite small or insignificant. For example, he would start getting very anxious if a classmate spoke to him in what he thought to be a different way, and worry about it for the whole day, repeating his feelings even after constant reassurance (I mean using the best of my ability, even though I logically know that nothing is actually wrong and he has nothing to worry about). He would also get really concerned about studying less than me (even though he studies much more often than I do), and whenever we get into arguments, he tends to let it weigh on his mind for hours after we already resolved the issue. He sometimes also speculates about issues that haven’t even materialised yet. 

He often tells me that he doesn’t feel sufficiently supported by me emotionally, and says I respond quite poorly sometimes (eg by offering solutions) which makes him feel very invalidated. I acknowledge this and know that I’m not really offering the support that he needs. My problem is that as a baseline, I find it difficult to offer emotional support to others. However, I find it even more difficult when someone is upset about something I consider quite small and insignificant, and on top of that, so regularly (maybe every other day) and for so long (sometimes the emotional rut can last for days). To be very brutally honest, sometimes I find these rants to reveal a very emotionally immature and childish side to him that I really don’t like - I start to question the entire relationship when these shut downs happen. I also think he might need some degree of therapy but can’t tell him this because he really hates therapy (when he was younger, people would tell him to go for therapy instead of addressing his issues head on, making him think it was kind of escapist). I told him that I feel extremely weighed down when I absorb all this negative energy from him, and that I hoped we could both work on our respective problems (him developing some more emotional resilience and myself developing more empathy and emotional support skills), but this issue still happens pretty often and honestly I feel pretty guilty about not wanting to support him through the tantrums that I find unreasonable. I was wondering if this problem could be resolved in any way, or if anyone else has experience with a highly emotional partner, or if this problem is really just all my fault/all in my head. Would appreciate any honest feedback or suggestions because it’s really weighing on me and I don’t know how to broach this issue again with him without triggering a shut down myself",0
776,"Crazy Nosy lady drives by my bus stop to judge me?!? Or what? This just happened and me and my husband are kinda pissed off about it. My 4 year old started pre-k yesterday (a full day of school and takes the bus both ways). We had a great day yesterday. This morning she is understandably a little tired and I started to rush out the door and that got her overwhelmed and she started to tear up about 5 minutes before her bus came. So we get outside, our bus stop is right outside our house we live at the end of a block so right on the corner, and I have her standing on our low garden wall hugging her before the bus comes. So we are standing there just hugging and I’m talking to her to help her calm down, my husband is standing right there beside us AND THEN - this lady pulls up in her car with her window down and is yelling from the driver seat 

“Is everything ok???”

We both look at her like she has 3 heads and reply with a very confused “ummm yea???” 

So she says 
“Ohhhh you’re just waiting for the school bus” - as the bus turned the corner onto our street 

we say “yep” 

she’s like “first day?” 

we’re like “no second” 

And she says “awwww ok then” and drives off. 

We weren’t about to yell at this older lady in front of our 4 year old, we don’t set that kind of example but….. 
Ohhhhh after my daughters school bus left were we furious. What is this women’s problem??? I was giving my little girl a hug on a street corner outside my house at 9 am??? What was going through her head?!?! What else would we have been doing on a street corner at 9 in the morning?!?!? Like I totally get mandate reporting and watching out for kids welfare but seriously 1 little girl hugging her mom while her dad is standing right there watching?!?! Her book bag was leaning on the wall right beside where we were hugging?!?!? Seriously people mind your business.",1
2306,"I’m (20F) not sure that I properly love anyone in my life 
I have always had trouble with building relationships and socializing. Thankfully, I did still found loving friends and family.

The thing is, with all of them, I love them but it’s in a clinical way, I -know- I care for them, but it’s not in any way I can feel. I’m not sure that I experience love like most people do. 

I do have empathy for people, but again, it’s a tricky area. I have empathy for people in more of an abstract way, like I strongly care for social justice, but when my friends/family are sad I understand that they feel that way and try to support them but I can’t share their feelings, in the way that their sadness doesn’t spread to me often.

A lot of the time, I’m too distracted or engaged in my interests than seeing or engaging in conversation with my friends or family is just a bother, I do it because I have to, not because I genuinely want to. Even conversations annoy me because they just take my time when I could instead be doing something I like to do, like attending to my interests.

I’m diagnosed with BPD, so I understand how my relationships might suffer from that. But I’m not sure if that’s the explanation for my feelings. I’ve talked with other people with BPD and they don’t seem to share my feelings. 

Some days I wonder if I can even love people at all, I struggle to maintain my friendships and relationships and I don’t know what do do anymore. I’m so disconnected from everyone and I feel very alone. I tried talking to my therapist about this but they don’t seem to understand the point I’m trying to make.",0
3090,"Really starting to think he (24m) doesn’t care about me (26f) Bf of 4 years and I broke up last year. Started talking again and it’s been about 6 months. We are practically together without the label. I do everything I can for him but every little mistake I make he blames me for, could get specific but so many incidents. 

He’s been going through a lot and ended up getting kicked out of home and been living in his car for a month. Suddenly decided to move out of state with a friend…he’s been out of state to see what it’s like for about a week and only texts me 2-3 times a day. No calls. I thought he would miss me but I’m not seeing that. When he’s here he’s always extremely irritable and very hard to be around but I stick around bc I love him. 

I love him so much, this whole situation is so painful and I’ve been so depressed that he’s leaving. He’s practically my only friend and I feel hurt that he’s putting such low effort to keep in contact

189," 12-18 yo's - Devices, The Internets, Supervision, and Parental Controls Looking for guidance and advice from the wise ones that have gone before me:

My older kid is starting 7th grade, and COVID stuff over the past while has meant they had more access to technology and the internet than they probably would have otherwise. 

Play dates turned into playing video games together online, or talking on FaceTime or Zoom. Talking on the playground turned into texting with iMessage. Lots of TV, probably too much free time on YouTube, I'm guessing most of you know the deal. 

As we go back to school, we're looking to get more clear and formalize some structures around what we allow and how we track it. Right now he has access to an iPhone, and iPad, and a MacBook, as well as a Roku TV, a PlayStation, and a Nintendo Switch. 

The phone is an old one we set up mostly for him to listen to music on (via a family Spotify plan) but he also uses iMessage / FaceTime to talk with friends and family. We do use Apple parental controls but they are confusing and not perfect, and he knows we can/will take the phone and look through it sometimes. We've mostly kept both Safari (web browsing) and YouTube disabled on this phone, but sometimes friends will send links to things that he can play, or send screen capture videos of cool TikToks or memes or whatever. 

The iPad is mostly for tablet games and drawing / art programs. This one has a password lock on the Home Screen, and it's logged into parent iCloud accounts, not his personal one. We have to unlock it for him to use it, but we don't track or supervise every detail here. He likes to watch YouTube videos on weekend mornings while his little sibling watches TV shows. 

The MacBook is a new development, replacing a Chromebook for school use with a cheap Mac that can do all the same stuff, but keeps him in the Apple eco-system, which is where most of the family devices are. We're still getting this set up and parental controls on the laptop vs the phone feel a bit confusing. 

The TV is what it is, it's on the living room wall so he doesn't get a ton of time where he can access it and not have other people see what he's doing. We have parental control locks on some of the channels (like he can't get to adult shows on Netflix) but the big picture of how this works means that he can range pretty freely here when he's home alone. 

The two gaming systems are pretty locked down, with parental controls apps that restrict play, and restrict online interaction somewhat. I don't think I understand how all the details work as well as I'd like but in general, he only gets time on these when I unlock them for him. 

All in all, I feel super confused as a parent in terms of what to allow and how strict to be, and even more confused about how to manage and limit what he sees and does. But I know there is a lot of stuff on the internet - both in the porn realm and in the shitty human behavior realm and in the conspiracy / mens rights activism / incel / white supremacist / etc realm that I don't love him wandering the wilds of the WWW on his own. But I also know that it's where his schoolwork lives, his friends hang out, and where he learns about artists and musicians and styles and events he likes so.. 

I'd love to hear any stories or advice about both the details - like what sort of limitations or software controls you have in place, and what agreements or expectations you set with kids - and the bigger picture - like how do we teach our kids to navigate this stuff in a healthy way.",1
387,"Unwell &amp; injured SAHM &amp; husband at work. I have a 1 year old.

466,"Just an Auntie who's worried. Hey there, so I'm not the parent... but not once but twice I've been put in the situation where I've basically raised my brothers kids. 

The first time I raised his kids, was when he only had one. I took care of the baby from the time he was 5 months until he was basically a year old. I handled everything. 7 years later they have had another baby and I spent 7 months with this little guy. He's my mini-me. I taught him how to walk, shake his booty, find his eyes ears nose and mouth, eat solid foods I did it all, while also being the person my 7 year old nephew's school spoke to rather then his parents. 

Anyways, I need some advice. In Janurary my brother kicked me out and I didn't see my youngest nephew from Janurary until the end of July when my brother decided to allow me back into the kids lives. And now the youngest is 2 years old and he;'s not speaking. He says uh oh, and hi. You can tell he tries to speak but he just doesnt. He's very good at showing you what he wants and bringing you to it. But no words are coming out. 

I actively try to get him to speak every time I'm with him. I give him the 100% attention he needs that he doesn't get from his parents. (They are too busy outside smoking and having their faces in their phones then to actually sit with their kid) 

I want to help my youngest nephew speak, I just want advice on how to get him to use his words rather then to point and make babbles at us. Like I'm taking this on as my personal project to get this little guy to speak. 

Now I know, I know kids will speak when they are ready, I know I didn't speak until I was 3. But I want to at least try to get him to talk... 

(I also don't mean to parent shame my brother and his wife, but there are some people that just shouldn't have kids - And it's a complicated story, I've seen and heard things that... well, it's a long story. )

1513,"First week of school, both sons (17 and 15) involved in a fight Both of our sons currently attend a private, K-12 school. The dress code is formal. Boys are required to wear a jacket, slacks, dress shirt,belt and tie in all academic buildings from 8AM-3:15PM. That’s the rule stated in the handbook. 

On Friday afternoon, it happened that our sons, 17 and 15, and another boy had caused a bit of a disturbance. Shortly after dismissal, our oldest son went to the basketball court to hang out with his friends for a bit before heading home. They were shooting around and it got nasty when DS17 started giving some kid shit about losing. The kid made a comment about his girlfriend, who had literally just been sitting on the bleachers doing her work. No need to type it here, but I do think that my son’s anger was justified. Perhaps not his reaction, but definitely his anger. 

It happened such as this: 

Our oldest was goading his friend’s friend about beating him. DS15 started ducking as if dodging bullets and said that if he wasn’t careful, DS17 was going to shoot the lights out. It is a common basketball reference. The kid said what he said about DS17’s girlfriend and DS17 told him to watch his mouth. Typical teenager shit ensued. Kid: “What are you gonna do” Kid proceeds to talk more stupid, misogynistic shit about his girlfriend. Some of the other guys there tried to kick him off the court, which he didn’t like, and told my sons that they’re “diversity students.” DS17 told DS15 and his girlfriend that it was time to go and as they were leaving, the kid said some really offensive shit, audible enough for DS17’s girlfriend to hear this time. 

DS17 turned around and said he was a sore loser and just mad. DS17’s girlfriend told him not to worry about it, “let’s just go”, there was a shove from the other kid as he was walking away and then they both were punching each other. DS15 tried to pull DS17 off of the other kid and it led to a bigger fight. 

The other guys at the court finally separated them, by which time a coach and an administrator (the Dean of Students) had gotten there. The reason DS17 seems to be in hot water is because as the coach got him off of the kid that was talking shit, he asked the kid if he wanted some more and yelled at the kid that he had “plenty more for him.” 

DS15 and three other guys that were there verified that DS17 was shoved first, what this kid said about them being “diversity students” and my son’s girlfriend. The Dean told DS17 that he was receiving a month of detention and the only reason he wasn’t suspended was because he didn’t want to ruin his college application process by having a suspension noted on his transcript. 

Apparently, his punishment also comes from violating the dress code and being hostile by his words. He was wearing his t-shirt that he wears under his dress shirt and had taken his jacket off to play ball, as had the other boys. I pointed out that it was after hours and not inside an academic building. The Dean said that the spirit of the rule had still been violated. I asked if he frequently changed the spirit of the rules where the letter is unmistakeable and he said he didn’t appreciate my insinuation. 

He mentioned that he knew DS17 was a good student so I asked why he was treating this as a regular occurrence and I was reminded of zero tolerance. 

It is worth noting that the kid DS17 got into a fight with is the son of one of the guidance counselors at the school. DS17 said that he wasn’t punished at all. I am not privy to the other boy’s punishment and I did ask, but was only told that he was also punished appropriately and nothing further. 

DS15 is in the same boat because the kid said that DS15 said DS17 was going to shoot him. DS15 repeated that he said DS17 was going to “shoot the lights out” and explained again what shoot the lights out meant in basketball and the Dean wasn’t interested and told him that he had already made his point. And that his punishment would stand because his comments were vulgar and in poor taste, even as he’d intended them. 

I told DS15 that it was okay and that I knew what he’d meant, which earned me a really judgmental look from the Dean. 

I didn’t think to say this in the meeting but it feels like he’s punishing for them for being black and sans country club culture. I probably didn’t make it any better for them but as we were getting ready to leave the office, the Dean stuck his finger in DS15’s face and told him that even though this was his first year, he wasn’t going to tolerate any more nonsense from him and I told him to take his hand out of my son’s face. Then he had this really odd look on his face and said good afternoon to me and my sons. 

My wife wants to fight it because of the “diversity student” comments but it could be argued that they got off easy for being involved in a fight. AND we don’t know if the other kid was actually punished. He could’ve told DS17 anything to piss him off. 

I told him that I am proud of him for attempting to walk away and handle it maturely initially, DS15 trying to stop it etc. I am obviously really angry about the comments because we sent them there for a better education and they had the grades and got it on merit. I hate that they had to hear that. I don’t want to pursue this because it seems that the boys, even though they think they were treated unfairly, would rather let it go and I also do not want to give that man reason to gun for them even harder.",1

14,Should kindergartener find her own locker So my daughter had a rough go at starting kindergarten and cried for the first week at school drop offs. My daughter is super shy so I thought maybe she was intimidated by having to walk to find her locker and classroom by herself since I can’t enter the school with the covid guidelines. So then I began to ask the teacher that was attending the door if they could find someone to help her to her locker and after that drop offs went smoothly with no crying. Well today apparently the lady at the door didn’t hear me and so my daughter said she walked by herself but she asked if I can have someone help her to her locker tomorrow. Now I’m conflicted because she’s been in school for 3 weeks now so I think maybe it’s time to take the next step and have her walk herself. But If i push her to walk by herself to her locker she may begin having meltdowns at drop off again but if I don’t push her out of her comfort zone and force her to walk herself she would probably go the entire school year wanting someone to escort her to her locker,1
524,"Get Rid of Changing Table? My 27 pound, 15 month old, has always hated laying on the changing table, but I’m a pretty tall woman so it’s helped save my back.

What do you use to help change your little ones? I don’t really like using my bed because if he fights and rolls away, he can get urine or feces on my bedding.

He was very mean the last time I saw him, glaring at me and giving silent treatment for no reason with no lead up or context and leaving me confused and hurting. He can be controlling and very jealous of other males to the point where I've had to seriously curtail my outings and social network. He threatened one of them and told me 'only I can have you.' I have felt intimidated by him in person by body language, suspicion, and other things. 

He has upped the amount of digital contact with me since the last time I saw him, knowing I am not going to see him again. His messages basically consist of he has someone (an ex with whom he's had an on and off again relationship) and it's wonderful and he's not going to be around, etc, etc. I do not get it. He could always stop contacting me. If he did, there would be no communication between us. I believe he was at least borderline obsessed with our relationship, wanting to know if I went out and if so with whom. I could only speak to him a certain way, careful not to challenge or disagree with him as well. 

There's also a recent incident where twice (and possibly a third time) he seemed to know where I was at the exact time I was. He texted asking me about a me being in a place over an hour away when I happened to be there. I had not told him prior nor posted online, but he seemed to know. 

TL;DR He (35M) keeps contacting me to say it's over after I already ended relationship and stopped reaching out",0
2032,"My BF said we have great chemistry over the phone but not in person My boyfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for about 4 years now.  So majority of our relationship, we have communicated via phone calls or FaceTime (a little texting too, but we both prefer to talk over the phone).  Typically, we spend about a week together a month on average.  

Today, as we were on the phone laughing about something together, he casually said how he feels like we have better chemistry when we are over the phone than in person.  Like he doesn’t feel like it’s there when we are together.  

I’m not really sure what to make of if and it’s stuck in my head now.  I’ve never felt that way before, I always thought we had great chemistry in person and over the phone.  Like I definitely feel I have better conversations with him over the phone, but I always felt we had a great time in person too.  I always attributed any lack of attention in person to his poor attention span because he easily gets distracted by everything.  Like I feel comfortable around him to be myself and even if we aren’t talking, I’m ok to just be around him doing something mundane.  But now I’m rethinking all of our interactions.  

He has bad attention span and always gets distracted when we are together, like by his phone or the TV.  He always wants to watch TV when we are just hanging out at home and I never thought much of it, so I would watch stuff with him as a way for us to spend time together doing something he enjoys.  

Is it my fault for not getting him to spend quality time with me when we’re together?  Or is just that he doesn’t find me interesting enough in person?  But why would he continue to be with me if he feels that way?  Isn’t talking on the phone the same as talking in person, how is it possible to have more chemistry over the phone but none in person?",0
2493,"My mom doesn’t want to talk to me but will do yard work around my house? I don’t know what to make of this. I’ve always had a weird relationship with my parents in general but my mom and I have always had a severely strained relationship. Most of my childhood memories of her involve her yelling, being mad, or just saying mean things to me. I would never go to her for any type of advice or comfort. We live 20 mins away and I invite my parents over for dinner because I feel societal pressures to say I spend time with them…we keep the conversation surface level and spend a good amount of time talking about my dog and their dog. My husband does a lot of talking.


Recently my mom called and said she wants to come over to my house to weed my yard. I said ok. My mom has been coming over to the house and weeding. I’ve been working at home so I see her out there working. When I invited her to come inside for lunch she doesn’t want to. I try to make small conversation and she’ll talk for a bit but then she wants to go back to work. She’s been coming over for two weeks and sometimes I don’t even go out there now. I leave the gate unlocked and she just weeds and leaves.


I don’t get it. I don’t know if she’s trying to manipulate me or what. I’m an only child so I’m wondering if she’s trying to be nice now that she’s and my dad are getting more feeble. Anyone have any experience with this?

658,"Am I justified to report my daughter’s former Daycare to Child Protective Service? I started my 18 mon old at a local daycare and it has been a strange ride. Their director lady complained about her crying and being clingy to teachers since Day 1 (isn’t a 18 mon old supposed to cry?). On Day 4, the director sat us down and gave us a  book, urging us not to respond to her crying and to “let her cry out” at home so that she can learn to self soothe. We are new parents and stupid enough to believe all this crap.  We even bought coffee and donuts for all teachers as token of appreciation that our daughter brought them “too much work.”  

Nevertheless, director lady demanded we pull her out on Day 13. Quoting our last communication verbatim, my 18 mon old daughter was crying “inconsolably” outside her office so she “could not work” and “only sent one email” that morning. They “cannot start the new school year like this.” In fact, kiddo was sick at the time—- she came home with a heavily congested nose and a low-grade fever. My Mom friends urge me to report this awful place to local child protective service because of: 

— incompetence: the director lady has never worked in childcare before. Her LinkedIn profile indicates she’s in finance all her life. And I know it’s not nice for me to say, but it’s a material fact that her FB profile shows she is single and doesn’t have her own kids. So no childcare experience at all.  To the extent, on my last pickup, she showed me several recordings of my daughter crying alone as evidence that she “cried too much.” Is this a joke?!

— under staffing. Our state requires 1:6 for the 18-24 mon age group. But we have been called up frequently to pick kiddo up midday merely because she woke up early from nap and no teacher had the spare time to play with her. One time my husband told me he peeked thru the window and saw there was only one teacher watching about 10 napping kids. She could not leave the room to take my awake and crying daughter out so they demanded pickup. 

So should I report? One reason I hesitate is bc I still believe the teachers are kind and did what they could for my daughter.  They always encourage me that kiddo is doing better day by day .  don’t want to bring any trouble to them. It’s more of a problem of their management ppl.",1

I feel uncomfortable with the situation (I haven’t told him that) and he isn’t close with his sister but I told him I don’t want him to make a decision based off of what I feel and he should do what he feels is right.

My dad gives me money to spend, and in the past, I usually ordered things for her off of Amazon and food delivery as well. It just happens to be that their marriage was messy and she was a stay at home mom, so she saw that money as her own almost.

To give a bit more context, when my sister got her first job, my mom was upset that she didn’t give her money. We’re Asian so it may be a cultural thing but still I think it’s messed up.

1771,"Should I (23m) cut this woman off (23f)? We matched on Tinder. I have an actual bio with some specific hobbies/interests that she was into. We started talking about our common interests and from there I asked her on a date. She agreed - but on the premise that she's only looking to casually date. I had no problem with this as I'm in college and there's plenty of opportunities. 

Anyways we met up in public for the first time and the date went more than great. You know how sometimes you go out with a woman, and you're like ""yeah I'd see them again"" or ""nope"". You can have a good date and that just be it. But I hadn't felt a connection to a woman like this in 5 years. We have a lot of common, including similar long term ambitions. I could tell by her body language, laughter, and just how she looked at me that she was into me. She planned a second date during the first one. We sat in a restaurant for 2-3 hours in awe at each other and have been talking about how much we look forward to seeing each other again ever since. 

And here comes the problem: she's living with her ex. Apparently they signed a lease together, broke up, and don't have the money to move out. She said he's moving out in a couple months. Which is fine. I knew what I was getting myself into. Something causal, some fun. But I can feel myself developing feelings despite having no delusions about the reality of the situation.

1434,"Playdate- HELP! My son is nervous about starting kindergarten this upcoming week. I was researching ways to help, and an article said it helps to know someone or have a friend going to the same school. That way your child feels less isolated. Great idea!  
I posted in the school's Facebook group asking if anyone has a child attending kindergarten at (name of school) and would like to have a playdate prior to the first day. A couple of people said yes, so I set a place and time. The idea took off and now we've got more kids than I had been envisioning. No problem there, but I do I have a question.   
Since I set the date and time (it's at the school playground) am I responsible for anything else? Like, am I a host? Do I need to provide refreshments? Games? Bubbles? Do I have to plan an activity other than just playing on the playground?    
I don't mind either way and am glad we've got a nice-sized group of kids together, but having never hosted anything like this, and being EXTREMELY socially awkward, I wanted to confirm what my role is.

Im a guy, and ive fallen in love with a girl whose been through some rough stuff which i wont get into. and those experiences have caused her to feel worthless and also to kinda not allow her to love again if that makes sense, like she just has that mental block there.

Now, she has told me she likes me very much and would love to have a relationship, but she just cant deal with feeling vulnerable and letting someone in, and shes told me she just needs time.

Now what im doing currently is just always being there for her, letting her vent her feelings to me and everything and just trying my best to make her happy, and wait till she is ready.

I would love to know if you guys think im doing the right thing, its not my top priority to get into a relationship, at this point i just want her to feel happy and she says shes happy to always have me around.

3222,"I texted my ex back to apologize but apparently we still have feelings for each other. Some context: we started dating back in 2018, everything went smooth as butter for nearly three years but mr. pandemic hit us hard and in late 2020 we had to split up. The break up was terribly harsh and none of us expected to end thay way because, well, our relationship was nearly perfect (yes, i dare to say that) for a long time. We tried to get back together without much success, I was mentally a fucking mess, friction between us increased and after another couple of terribly tense weeks we finally ended it for good. We blocked each other from everywhere and therefore cancelling all contact between us. 

Well, that last bit was in early april. In june she texted me some sort of apology herself and then blocked me again. It was a bit ambiguous so I never fully understood the purpose of the message.

Last friday I realized that my alt Instagram account was the only one she didn't block, so I decided to dm her to apologize for being such a dick. I asked her if we were in peace but the conversation ended up being much longer than I expected. We talked again as friends, as if nothing had happened, and to be honest, I'm a lonely guy so I haven't had much contact like this with other people since she left and it felt really good. Sure, I was wary because I still remember how our last talks ended but fortunately this one was pretty peaceful. I didn't mention she got a boyfriend shortly after our fall out, but it seems the guy lives in another country so it's an even longer distance relationship than ours (we live 3km apart lmao). Well, so she was very nice and she said she was sorry once again and afterwards she told me that ""karma is hitting her"". I'm assuming that she is not fully comfortable with her current relationship but I don't want to interfere there. We ended our talk and I said that sometimes I miss her and she reciprocated. She even said she dreams with me every now and then (not in a romantic way, just like I make a cameo or something like that lol) 

Now, like I said, I was very wary and tried to keep all my answers conservative, but honestly I haven't clicked with anyone like I did with her and she seemed to enjoy our little talk too. I kinda hate to admit it but I felt really good. Could this finally be the time to fix our love relationship or I'm just taking it too far due to this brief feelgood moment?",0

1978,"I think my (23F) older brother (30+M) is trying to gaslight me? This is something that has been throwing me through a loop for a while. I am going to start with a quick backstory before we delve into the issue. I don't know what other subreddits I can go to, this one matches closest to my rather unique situation. I haven't seen anyone else go through this issue.

BACKSTORY: My older brother had to grow up too fast due to situations out of his control. His father is in jail for.. unspeakable things which I won't delve into and has been out of the picture ever since. Brother and my mum escaped a DV situation and they were on their own for a while. I don't know how old my brother was when this all occurred, except that he was likely in the very first 2-3 years of school. Mum struggled mentally. A lot. But she did everything she could to try and ensure my brother could still be a kid such as putting him into the local rugby team (which he loved) and having him spend time at his grandparents when things got on top of her. Eventually she met my Dad, a farmer. They fell for each other and got married, and his family accepted both Mum and brother with open arms and hearts. Mum gave birth to my other brother (who only needs to be mentioned this once) and then to me. Both Mum and Dad did work on the farm, brother did chores such as chopping wood and watching us if Mum and Dad had to run out in a hurry (Fire, cow struggling to birth... farm emergencies) and things were fine. Nothing seemed to be wrong, even looking back now. My brother was in high school at this point and he seemed happy. 

Then there was a nasty few years, from the end of high school to when he turned 21 where a lot of traumatic things happened to him. Witnessing a rather gruesome suicide, losing friends to murder, losing his boyfriend/best friend who was on the front line, delving into drugs. These caused a big change in my brother. He also started working full time, but decided to stay at home due to these issues. He became very aggressive, cruel, had anger issues and he often took them out on us. He has a ""everything is everyone elses fault, never mine!"" thing which has never gone away, it only seems to of gotten worse over time. Mum and Dad struggled with this, mostly because he only showed this side when they were at work (my other brother was in high school and I was middle school aged at this point, so we were fine on our own). There were points where he got aggressive despite my Mum being home and would hit us or shake us, Mum would have to get involved physically and restrain him for his safety and ours. There was even a time where he pointed a blade at his heart in front of us and threatened suicide because he was so mentally unstable at that point. That scared me. Then my Granddad passed away suddenly and my Nana lived with us for the remainder of her life. The presence of my Nana was able to soothe and calm this side of him completely. He still had issues, but nothing near what they were.

Now... on to the issue. 

My brother and I are quite close. He still lives at home, I've moved out and have my own family. When he needs to get away from home, he knows my house is a safe place with beer in the fridge and nephews to play with who adore him (whether it be on consoles or outside). We often have conversations, deep conversations, about his mental health. However something has started popping up which is disturbing me greatly. He started talking about how my parents would apparently beat him. He names situations and such which conflicts with my own memories and whenever I mention this, he quickly switches to ""It happened before you were born."" or ""you would of been too young to remember properly"". There are multiple things he has brought up though, where I clearly remember it VERY differently and I told him so. What makes it hard though is that, if true, this makes him a victim and I don't want to be telling a victim that they are wrong. But it is very interesting that all these things suddenly stopped when I was ""old enough to remember"" and simply stopped happening from then on. We were also by our brothers side whenever we were all home either playing games, chilling and watching TV or helping with chores. There wasn't any time where any of this could of happened have neither myself or my other brother notice it. Especially not multiple times a day like he claims. 

Whenever I do bring up what I remember, he tries to spin it until eventually he goes to ""I was abused, I am like this because of them"". When I bring up how awful we was to us during his later teenage years, he simply says ""I am not proud of that time, but people only replicate what was done to them"". That made me very angry. But I can't help the side of me that says ""what if?"" even though it sounds ridiculous to me. Everything in his life that has eventually led to where he is now, is apparently all my parents fault. I am doing my best to help support him and urge him to go to therapy for his PTSD and other issues (he is seeing a therapist for a completely different thing right now and I feel it's making this worse) but he claims there is no point until he moves out. I really want to know if I am being awful here, or if he is actually trying to gaslight what I remember to suit him. The only other person I can talk to about this is my partner who is on my side, but I really need unbiased opinions and advice no matter how awful (within reason) you think of me at this point.",0

1186,"Toddler Sleep Battles So our soon to be 3 year old has been bad about sleep lately. We have a good bedtime routine of pajamas, potty, teeth brushing, books, and a back rub. Lately she keeps getting out of bed and crying for us to come lay with her.

Unfortunately, the 1 year old is a much lighter sleeper than he used to be and his bedroom is across the hallway. When she cries and carries on it wakes him up.

My plan to get her back is to just give her space, but when the time comes, I’m gonna show up to see her and just give her a little self care basket with 2 candles and one of them sprays from bath and body works. Maybe I’ll throw in a scrub for good measure. Then I’ll just apologize to her and explain everything. 
Is my relationship with her salvageable? I feel like we’re not really broken up, but we’re just separated. She hasn’t blocked me on social media, but just the phone (maybe idk). I don’t wanna give up this easily when I know I can make it work for both of us.",0
1699,"My [22f] boyfriend [23m] is upset I’m not jealous he’s hooking up with other women We met like 3 months ago and started an open relationship. He knew I already had another boyfriend. He’s told me several times that he was going to hook up with other girls and I’ve been fine with it. He told me today he was going to go see a girl and I said ok and he got upset that I wasn’t jealous and said it means I don’t care about him. We’ve already told each other I love you so obviously I do care about him.

He doesn’t get jealous of my other boyfriend so I’m not sure why he thinks I should be jealous. He asked me the other day if he hung up on me to talk to another girl would I be jealous and I said probably a bit and he said “finally, proof you’re not a fucking robot”. I mean I probably would care more but if he’s just having one night stands I’m really not concerned at all.

I really think it would be hypocritical for me to be jealous since I’m dating someone else. So I’m not really sure what to tell him.",0

1135,"Help! Child is ""overweight"". How to approach this subject DELICATELY? I want to start off first with a little background on myself and clarifications. I grew up with a horrible body image set upon me by my mother. She was beautiful; I looked up to her beauty standards and she never built up my self-confidence. As a matter of fact, she crushed my self-image and worth on a daily basis (you'll never be pretty enough, you're getting too fat, blah blah blah). Obviously, this made me develop my horrible self-image and also some eating disorders that I'm still working on as an adult. Having my kids helped let go of a lot of those images of myself. Also, I've vowed to NEVER repeat this as a mother of girls. 

Now, I'm a mother of two very amazing girls. Because of ALL the crazy things my mother used to say to me that has affected me mentally, I am very cautious about how I approach most subjects with my girls. It would break my heart for them to develop some sort of complex because of something I've said or done to them in childhood. 

My two girls are complete opposites, like most siblings. My oldest is a ""computer nerd"", she loves video games and electronics, heavily influenced by her Dad. And my youngest likes to play outside and run around like a crazy person. I've tried getting them into activities such as gymnastics, aerial yoga, tennis, karate, etc. While my youngest is all for any of these activities, my oldest will try them for a bit but then loses interest. Also, paying for these extra activities has always been a struggle financially. I don't make much money and the money my husband makes goes towards bills and... You guys know the drill. Necessities before frivolity. 

I've always (not neurotically or anything) emphasized healthy balanced diets and exercise. My kids are not picky eaters, they love fruits and veggies, and we take nightly family walks around our neighborhood with our pup. I have always told them it's my job as a Mom too make sure they are healthy kids to set them up to be healthy adults.

Now, to my issue, finally. My oldest is 10. She's not very active, other than swimming and our nightly walks, she's not really into doing much. She's never really been and I feel like I can't really push that onto her (When I was younger I would rather read a book than go outside and play). She was weighed at school yesterday in her PE class (I totally have an issue with this, btw but that's another post) but she told me that only she and the coach knew the numbers. She weighed 115 lbs!! My husband and I are on the ""smaller"" side, height and weight, and so is her sister. And before anyone gets onto me, yes, I know how genetics work, and no, I don't expect her to be just like me or her Dad. BUT at 5 ft tall and 10 years old, I know that her weight is NOT healthy. (Although I've told her on many occasions that how you look as a child isn't necessarily how you will be as an adult).

I told my husband earlier today we need to have a family meeting in regards to nightly desserts (already gonna cut that out), screen time (too much time spent on the daily staring at their tablets) and getting more exercise AS A FAMILY. 

My question is how to approach this discussion with her DELICATELY? What are some options to give her and what can I do to encourage her to be healthier? 

I don't want to in any way make her feel like there's something wrong with her or for her to be ashamed of her body. What I want to do is get a head start on this issue before it becomes a bigger issue for her later in life.",1
317,"Separation Anxiety in 5 year old at school drop-off My son is 5, just started Kindergarten last week, and he clings to me and cries every single day when it's drop-off time. Covid regulations mean I'm not allowed to walk him to his class, I can only drop him off in front of the school in the car line or by walking up to the main entrance. The school would prefer that I bring him through the car line, but every day so far they've had us pull around to the main entrance because they don't want to drag him out of the car.

He is perfectly fine once he is in the classroom. The teacher updates me some days with how he is doing and he's always having fun, making friends, and participating in the activities. It's just getting him into the school that's the issue. We have tried explaining to him that I always come back, offering to go to the park (which he loves) after I pick him up, accompanying another child in his class to the classroom, rewards such as fun snacks and activities at pickup, distracting him up until drop-off time, and flat out talking him through the process. My aunt who is local may start bringing him in the morning which will make drop-off easier most likely (he's less likely to cry and cling to her) but it'll still be hard getting him to leave the house with her without me.

Also, last night for the first time in years he did not go to bed willingly for a good hour. He clung to me and kept insisting a monster was going to come or someone was going to come into our home and take me away. It brought me near to tears. I reassured him that there were no monsters and that no one was going to take me away, but he kept hugging me and at one point started crying.

I am all my son has and I completely understand why he has these anxieties. There is also a chance he is on the spectrum (his pediatrician believes he is but she wants him checked out by a developmental behavior pediatrician before officially diagnosing him) and that has some of my relatives convinced that that's the reason he has such a hard time.

It breaks my heart seeing him go through this every day. I guess I have a couple of questions:

1. For parents with children who struggle or have struggled with separation anxiety, how did you get them used to going to school?
2. For parents of children on the spectrum, was this an obstacle for you as well?

If my son does end up with the diagnosis I'm wondering if I may be able to accompany him to his classroom. I am fully vaccinated but I'm not sure if me accompanying him all the way to the room will help or make it worse. I'm just trying to be a good parent and not mentally scar my child for life while simultaneously not coddling him too much... It's a really hard balance. Any advice or help is appreciated!",1
2421,"(Followup) I(33M) Troubled my wife(32F) over non monogamy, now she is telling our whole family about it, instead of working on a solution **I am not complaining about my wife, I know I made a terrible mistake and she would be angry, sad, resentful and would do things that she wouldn't do normally. I am looking for steps ahead here.**  
So, I posted previously that I wanted to open relationship and my wife was not fine with that. I being stupid negotiated so hard for over an year (I know this was so stupid and asshole move from my end, and she has all the rights to be angry at me).   
I found it hard to wrap my head around the fact that if she was not fine (even if she didn't look into it closely, because she was not bound to, because marriage means monogamy. I could only ask, she said no, and it should have ended here, but I am bad at quitting and ended up pushing it for too long.  
Now she has left me, and is telling her family, my family and close relatives (they all are very conservative). 

Note that I am not trying to make it up to her because now my 'reputation' is at stake, I genuinely wanted to do what is best for her, I just didn't realise I am pushing a negotiation too hard. I want to be with her, always wanted to. Never loved anyone ever since we are together.  
We have talked about talking to a therapist (and I already don't want to do open marriage, I think I am done with that. This was the tipping point), but telling our families does not help in any way, it just harms.  


I have no rights to complain, and I will suck it up, because that's the price I need to pay. But what should I do now?

So as a punishment I said he could not go out, and this was not just over this one thing, over the past year or so we have had to ask him multiple times to do something before he would do it, and he would say he forgot quite a few times when we asked why he didn’t do what we asked, so do you think not allowing him to go out was an acceptable punishment?",1
1955,"I’m taking care of my “separated” husband and I don’t know what the next step is We’re both in our 20s and we have a baby daughter together. My husband has a history of depression and PTSD from CSA. My husband has always been insecure about things, and I’ve always built him up and helped him heal. He was very worried about becoming a father and was effectively absent after birth. He ended up having sex with another woman, and after that I found out he had been having an emotional affair with her too.

I still love him, but I can’t stay with a man who cheats on me—it hurt to just look at him, I couldn’t imagine touching him and continuing to be his wife.

He moved back in with his mom and ended up trying to kill himself. It wasn’t in a way where he was trying to get me to come back to him, he almost died, and I found out he had started self-harming too.

I made it clear to him that we weren’t reconciling but I thought he should move back in for a bit. He’s become a lot more of an attentive father since and our relationship is a lot more amicable, we’re almost back to being normal, close friends, but then the hurt kicks in and I feel like we can never be close again.

Last night, we ended up having some sexual contact and this morning he was treating it like we’re getting back together, when we are not. Which is what I told him. I told him it might be time he starts looking for his own place and he told me he loves being in this house with our daughter and he never feels so happy like this when he’s away from us. He has been making mental health strides but I don’t want him confusing me anymore and giving me all of this hurt. This is all so humiliating, can I have some advice on this like you’re my friend?

2660,"My girlfriend broke up with me, then made the break up my fault and finally still expects me to be there for her kids… My (41m) girlfriend (50f) of slightly more than a year and a half made the decision we wouldn’t be sleeping together anymore and decided to tell me on my birthday…

When we initially started dating she had mentioned that she wanted to date a man who could provide for her and her two daughters (13 &amp; 11). Whilst I wasn’t In that position initially I figured my business was picking up and also, maybe once she got to know me better and saw my many other positive attributes my financial position would matter less… then Covid struck… my business almost disappeared and I was not making the strong headway I expected, still we stayed together and I grew closer to her daughters and spent a good deal of time staying at their apartment often for weeks at a time…

After about 13 months of being together the financial support issue came up again… she wanted me to arrange a three bedroom place for us all to live in and I had only recently arranged my own one bedroom apartment and I said I wasn’t in a position to do that… she was upset but didn’t make much more of it… things continued much as before for the next six months…

Then on my birthday about a month ago we were lying in bed and I leant over to cuddle and she pushed me away and said we weren’t doing that anymore… I asked what she meant and she said as I couldn’t provide for her and the girls she wouldn’t be with me anymore… then she said that if I really loved her and the girls I would do whatever it took to support them and it was I. Fact my decision to not do that so I was breaking up with her due to my inability to provide…

She then stated that it would be unfair for me to just stop seeing her daughters as I had spent the last year and a half making the girls care about me and abandoning them would be wrong…

I just feel manipulated at this point and I’m not sure what to do…",0
1064,"ADVICE - Making up to my parents for being an ungrateful son Hi,

I'm a 19 M. I really screwed up with my parents big time, and want to set things right. 

It is a really long story and I dont want to discuss the details.

But, my parents are loving parents who have sacrificed everything for me and care about my wellbeing over everything else. I had a super good relationship with them growing up.

 But, recently, it was not smooth sailing as I blamed my parents for everything, even though it was my fault. I made them feel like they were terrible parents and failed me this past year and a half. I also held onto somethings that they said when they were angry and used these words against them, even though they have done so much for me and love me a lot. It was like I expected them to be perfect and got too hung up on bad words here and there. I wasn't grateful enough to truly appreciate what they did for me. Also, my parents would try to give me advice, but I took that as them forcing me to live a life I did not want. Even though they would not force me and were simply advising. I had many issues over this covid/quarantine (some related to loneliness and failure) and blamed them for everything.  I was always a top student at high school, and when the first year of college did not go as well as I wanted because I was busy on the internet (as I felt lonely because I was doing it remotely), I blamed it all on them for not giving me an environment to focus. There were also family issues with regards to in laws and between my dad and mom. They were also financial issues. So, I would blame them for bringing it up infront of me and making me lose my focus, when they honestly did nothing wrong. It was all because of me losing my focus and being on the internet to deal with my loneliness. Whenever something went wrong, I would blame them.I even blamed them for me being suicidal at a point of time, even though they had nothing to do with it. 

And now, they always talk very nicely to me, even after all I have done. They still love me a lot and continue to work day and night to finance my college education. But, I know that deep inside, it kills them because they think that they were bad parents who failed to act as proper parents. Because of my own issues and needing a way to escape blame, I put it all on them and caused them to be depressed as they think that they failed me. They r going through very rough emotional times because of me, even though they have been wonderful parents.

I know that I am an ungrateful asshole and it took me a month in college to figure this out, but how can I make up for the shit I have done. As you guys are parents, I would like your advice. How can I stop making them feel like they failed as parents, and help them feel better. How do I stop their pain and set things right. Again, I know that I am an asshole, and am really sorry to my parents. I want to fix things, but dont know how. Please help.",0

1661,"I think my boyfriends best friend is playing weird mind games with me My boyfriend (m21) and I (m22) have been together almost a year. In that time, I’ve only SEEN his best friend (f22) a total of three times. The first time I met her was fine, but the second and third times were bizarre and have led me to think that she is trying to play some weird mind game with me. 

The second time I met her was at my boyfriends birthday party. She had ignored me all night, which i found odd but I decided to do the mature thing and go say hello to her. She was sitting with a group of friends and her mother. I just said hi and that it was nice to see her again then introduced myself to her friends and mother. Throughout the entire interaction she was extremely rude and dismissive and made no effort to hold a conversation with me. Her friends and mother were exactly the same, her mother was perhaps the coldest and most standoffish of the entire group, even rolling her eyes at me. My friend came with me when I said hello to the group and agreed with me that the interaction was very strange and awkward, she also thought that they were all very rude. She left the party saying goodbye to pretty much everyone except for me which was also really weird. 

The last time I saw her was when I bumped into when she was out shopping with her boyfriend. I was walking towards a store when I saw someone glaring at me for an uncomfortable amount of time. It was a really dirty and intimidating glare.  I’d never met the guy before but I recognised him from photos and figured out that he was her boyfriend. I then saw her next to him which confirmed this to me. She didn’t see me and I just went about my shopping. My boyfriend later told me that his friend had text him saying that she saw me. This was strange because she didn’t see me, only her boyfriend did. Her boyfriend has never met me so he must have recognised me somehow and then told her that he had seen me, leading her to text my boyfriend. I don’t understand why he would glare at me with such disgust for no reason, so I believe that she’s probably talked about me to him, leading him to glare in attempt to intimidate me in public. 

All of this probably sounds ridiculous and I don’t care about it that much, but the weird part is that when I’ve brought it up to my boyfriend, he tells me that it must be a misunderstanding because his best friend always talks about how much she loves me etc. this is a weird thing to say about someone who you’ve met twice and then “seen” in public once. Even weirder when you, your friends, family and boyfriend have been super rude and dismissive towards me.  My boyfriend ended up discussing it with her as well as a few racist posts she had made on social media which made me super uncomfortable and she promises that it’s a misunderstanding and that she “loves me”. She apparently has denied that these events took place but I obviously know that they did. My boyfriend promises that it’s a misunderstanding but I don’t understand how my friend and I could have both misunderstood a situation where she (and her friends and family) were being blatantly rude and dismissive and how I could have misunderstood her boyfriend glaring at me for ages. 

I don’t know if she’s intentionally trying to confuse me or play mind games or if she just dislikes me and won’t say so, but it’s becoming a difficult situation to navigate because my boyfriend and her are really close and it really sucks knowing that she is being rude and strange towards me but can’t own up to it. I’m not sure how to go about this in the future so any advice would be appreciated. 

TLDR: my boyfriends best friend has been acting strange towards me and is often rude, only to deny it when my boyfriend brings it up and promises that she loves me. My boyfriend thinks I’m just imagining it all, but I know that I’m not. Unsure how to navigate this.",0

The long distance part wasn't that bad we even grew into each other more and it was fun talking to each other for long periods of time. 
For the past month she's been staying with her brother and sister and their kids in a village in the city she was in, she barely have time for me... our time together doesn't exceed 2 hours a day ""some days were less""
I understood the situation that she helps out with the kids and work around the house etc. 
but I've been feeling like shit for the past week! Her time over there is coming to an end soon, but I feel that I was forgotten about... this sudden change of routine is killing me, she used to tell me all about her day, and things that happened but not anymore. Even when we talk now I'm the one who's keeping the convo going ! I understand but my mental health wasn't very good these past couple of days and I really need someone to talk to, and when I tell her how I felt and stuff that I'm looking to be comforted about her reply is always ""Sorry"". 
Is she doing this on purpose ? 
Did she see an escape from our relationship in that specific stay and took it? 
I'm very mentally exhausted and I can't deal with this.... I tried to tell her about it but as I said ""sorry"" is always her reply and we don't have time to discuss such deep topic, or she doesn't! 
I should mention that I made time for her when I worked a 12 hour shift, it took me 2 minutes LITERALLY 2 minutes to update her every hour ! Apparently this 2 minutes mark is extremely valuable to her and she can't just text me something... not even a convo just a small update !

I just feel like no matter what I do it’s not helping them behave in school. The anxiety I feel when my phone rings during or after school is ridiculous. I get stressed out knowing the school week is starting again. During the weekend we have some issues, but nothing crazy so I just can’t understand how they act so “bad” during school time. I wish I would be told if they did something positive rather than always told the negative. I can’t say I’ve been on top of every thing they do, I can’t say I’m a perfect parent. At the end of the day I know I do a great job, I know I care and I know I try my hardest but it does not feel like enough.",1

I clearly do…. 

\-We have not have had sex in over a week.. because we have been arguing so much. I clearly want sex and he seems to want to work this out but actions show other

\-I am hurt... I am a speech pathologist and he said ""you work with kids, so that's not work at all"" 

\-Today I walked to a liquor store because he said I was to drunk to drive....

1045,"3-year-old and social anxiety I have a three-year-old boy that hits all the milestones... except when it comes to social skills. 

He has been relatively healthy (bronchitis is our friend) all his life and attends daycare on a daily basis. As both his father and I work full-time, he is at the daycare for around 8 hours a day.  His teachers there (all with Masters in Pedagogy) say he is progressing nicely, but they mentioned he is more introverted than other children. All daycare groups are also regularly observed by their in-house psychologist and they never noticed anything unusual about him. He had a period during last year when he avoided playing with kids in his group and was mostly focused on his teachers, but luckily, that has come to an end. 

So, the daycare is fine, but the life outside of it is a living hell. I think there might be social anxiety involved. He was never diagnosed. We did reach out for help, but most therapists in my country don't work with children that young. Clinical observation is also an option, but our family doctor told us the waiting lists are too long, and there is no way for her to give us priority as the kid is progressing fine, and is probably just shy. 

My husband convinces me everything is fine and normal, but I am not sure. Everyone says he'll grow out of it, yet I am concerned. 

He rarely wants to participate in new activities. For instance, if we are at the beach, he will not want to learn how to dive, jump, or play with water guns. Waterslides are a nightmare for him. 

The only birthday party we have been to ended up with me holding him in my lap. He said kids are scary and he doesn't like them. We arrived first, but as soon as he heard more kids are coming, he panicked and wanted to go home. 

We signed him up for some ju-jitsu classes. The groups are really small (up to 7 kids), and the trainer is our neighbor he knows and loves. After three minutes, he was screaming his lungs out saying he is scared of kids and he wants to leave. We had to pick him up. Then, another boy from his daycare group signed up as well. We believed this time our son will participate because there'll be a familiar face. Nope. as soon as other kids arrived, he took off his kimono and wanted to leave. 

When at a park, he'll never join other kids and will move as soon as someone comes close.

At home, he told me he wants to go to daycare, visit grandparents, and stay at home with mom and dad, and do nothing else. It broke my heart. He seems to be more functional surrounded by adults than by kids his own age. One of our friends noted he is rather serious and studious for his age, as he prefers to have fun learning about flags, music, etc., and not so much in getting involved in other activities that include children. 

He has a few friends at the daycare, and when he is playing with them 1-on-1 it works fine, as soon as more kids join (even the kids he knows), he wants to leave. 

I love him as he is, and don't want to change him. We have so much fun looking at my vinyl record and playing them. My little guy can recognize all members of the Beatles, Stones, Pink Floyd, and LZ. He can tell it's Taylor Swift playing on the radio, and tell the brand of card from across the street, without looking at the sign. When we go for a walk, he can tell what flag a kid passing by has on his shirt. I don't mind any of that, but I feel he is missing out on his childhood and all the fun. 

Any advice? Do I have a reason to be concerned? When will this agony of being afraid of new things and children end?",1

We planned a weekend together several months in advanced and a week before the trio she canceled due to covid cases have been too high. But she turned around and said I can drive to her (an 8 hour drive there and back) for just a day. 

I got mad and we argued. I claimed theres no difference in the end. Me and you there is the same as me and you here. but in the end I said fine I'll visit. 

So a few days in advanced I got a little flirty and was trying to talk dirty in a way to kinda spark something for when I'm there. And all I got was ""we have so many places to go"" ""we'll have fun""

I say I can't wait to hold you and kiss you. And all i got was ""let's go to park and take a walk"" 

So I asked her does she not even want to have sex? Like yeah sue me, I can't demand that. But I haven't seen her in months you'd think we'd do some thing like that. 
She doesn't. At all and I'm in the wrong for asking. 

I'm mad that a weekend got changed to a day. And I'm sad I can't see her as long, and I'm confused why she's acting like this. 
(If you want to be friends just say it, don't lead me on, by acting like this.)

I am very certain she's acting weird and it doensnt make sense.

2582,"Insecurities get you nowhere !! Hi all,

Just wanted to come out here and start this thread of events that are going to unfold in my life. Because I just found out that my significant other hid a camera in our living room without me knowing. Correction : He has told me couple of times that he did hide a camera and that he was watching me but I never took it seriously and I always followed it up with a joke. I even mentioned once to him that was toxic AF and laughed. Therefore, it was obvious that I didn't believe him and he didn't do anything to make me think otherwise. Or show me where it was. 

Well..... I fucking found I accidentally and I never knew I could get this mad. Like I'm so mad I'm calm.  I've never had anyone ever do this before. FYI, I never cheated or talked to anyone to make him ever think that I wasn't trustworthy so I'm leaving this here to update it later on what the fuck he has to say about it.

For the insecure boys out there. Get help and work on yourselves or people will leave you and make your insecurities worse. It's a vicious cycle that only you can fix.

2097,"Talking to my long distance girlfriend is like talking to a wall, also she has recently become distant and more dismissive and less engaged Okay. So I’m (22M) currently in a weird, possibly unique situation, so this will be a long post. TLDR: met a girl online, said love super early, talking to her is like talking to a wall, suddenly distant, never in mood for online sex.

I met a girl online (25F) through a childfree (people who don’t want kids) dating Facebook group. She was the one who messaged me. Eventually we started talking a good amount, and found we really liked each other. Unfortunately she lives in India and I’m in America (I’m Indian-American). But we found that we really like each other and it’s worth trying a relationship out. She’s going to be a diplomat who can live in whatever country her husband lives in. So eventually we can be together. 

The relationship moved quite fast. We poured our dark secrets and struggles. Like a week into it she tells me she loves me. Like really really means it. And of course I said it back because I think we are great together. We are two+ weeks into it and it’s been a little weird. She adds very little to conversations it feels like talking to a wall. Often she just says “okay” or “alright” in response to me saying something. Like dismissive and just ends the conversation. I asked her about it, and she was like yah you seem busy and might want stop talking. She has asked me in the past if she is too clingy Whicu baffled me bc she’s the opposite of clingy. I wish she was more clingy! I always carry conversations! She never initiates a topic, she just starts with hey and ends with alright. She said her last relationship she put in all the work and hated that it made her feel clingy. Well now I feel clingy and unwanted because I’m the only one engaging!

She also says I don’t understand women and I need to be better in understanding her. she’s stopped saying I love you or calling me babe/hun/dear. And there has been no sex stuff. I once asked her to send me a pic after her shower and she sent me some great nudes (everything but her vag) But she never wants to masturbate (she said she does masturbate, I asked her a weeek ago when was the last time and she said 1 weeek ago) together, “not in mood” was said the two times I asked. Recently she’s suddenly distant. Theoretically it could be her period but uhhh I’m never gonna ask that because that would be offensive. 

She said she loves me because of many personality traits I won’t bother listing all of them here. She has also said she doesn’t care how fat I am (5’6” 240 right now) and I could be even fatter and she wouldn’t care. She asked for my nudes after showing hers. She responded with starstruck and heart emojis which felt too gratuitous. That was two days before all this Behavior. 

Did my body make her like me less? (She knew my face and weight at the start of talking) Has she lost interest? Just a mood swing? Am I reading too much into simply not being in the mood? Why does she put so litttle effort in conversations? (It’s not an English issue, she learned school in English)",0
1890,"I want to stay away from my partner I am very lost in my relationship. I don't know what to do next in order to cope with the new things that have been happening with my partner and I.

So, I have this partner, let's call him C. We are actually in a long distance relationship as he lives in another country.  Due to the nature of his work, he has changing shifts and of course, can be very tiring. I am used to the fact that after my classes, he leaves work and goes home immediately. His timezone only differs for a few hours so he usually calls later in the evening. Sometimes, he immediately sleeps after arriving home without even telling me. I understand that and in fact, I am slowly making myself get used to it. The problem is, I feel like he does not give me much importance unlike how I do with him. I mean, I understand he is very busy and maybe it's his nature to not always update me.  Even when he calls, it only lasts for a while and does so while playing. Undivided attention where? 😅 

Right now, I don't know if it's just the hormones talking but I want to stay away or lie low for a while. It is not only this relationship that has been constantly making me anxious and depressed - I have classes and internship in my university and the latter has been stressful for me. I even want to breakdown because of it but I feel so alone because I have no one to tell about it. When my partner says I can always tell him, how can I do so when we never even get the time to talk? He is busy, okay. But it's frustrating to be assured of something that has a low chance of happening.",0

3134,"I ended my relationship thinking it would better my mental health but it's only gotten worse I met my girlfriend (now ex) in highschool when I was a sophomore and she was a freshman. We started dating in december of 2014. The first year it was amazing. Helped each other out in school and met families and everything seemed right. Summer of 2016 is when I got my very first actual job. Not helping mon and dad with cattle, but actual payroll job for road construction. I admit I got a little distant but my only excuse is I wanted to prove my worth to this company, and they actually found me useful and liked me. She cheated on me. Being 17 and young and dumb and still captivated by her, I decided we can look past this, and we stayed together. Then came high school prom which I'll never forget because she was a bit of a tomboy but to see her all fancied up and matching with my tux, ya know? It was a memory I'll never forget. Then school kept going by and she was a senior and I was a super senior because I had a hard time in school, so prom happened again. Then we graduated together. All this time but disregarding the summer of 2016 I devoted my stride to success for this woman, and promised myself im bettering myself for me, AND her. Fast foward to november of 2018 I get an evem better job as a mechanic for semis. The pay was great and I loved the work, and she half ass showed the ""you're doing well at work"" when I was trying to branch off from my parents insurance and cover myself so I could become an adult and start a life. I had about $15,000 saved up so me and her could get our own place, or rent. Then all the sudden the boss decided I was no longer needed at the job and I got let go, and so my savings went to repairs for my pickup, her car, and paying now my own insurance and phone as well as hers. I searched for months to find a job and then I started noticing she stopped putting effort in to show she was there for me. I applied to EVERYwhere you could think of, JUST to have a job and I would come home defeated every day. She shrugged her shoulders and would say ""something will come up eventually"". Now she started lashing out at me almost daily about how much of an asshole I am, and how I dont communicate when I would try to be as open as I could, she wanted me to change almost everything about me but when I asked for small subtle changed like how she treated me, it would always end in a screaming match. April of 2020 now and I went back to the road construction company and they took me in immediately. All of this was fine and dandy, worked all the way until November of 2020, now shes going out every weekend without telling me, or when she would leave, and when I would politely ask to know where she was or if she was even safe, I was yelled at and accused of sleeping with someone else? Now its March 2021 and I admit I shouldnt have but I got scared and went through her phone. And what I saw on snap chat between her and a guy ive never heard of made me vomit where I was standing. Yet again, dumb, and in love somehow, I put it behind. Now its summer of this year, road construction is absolutely off the walls busy. Im pulling 14hr days, coming home tired as hell but still wanting to interact with her, and she always had an excuse to not do anything like watch our TV show we liked, or sit and talk, or play video games with each other. July 26th, my 22nd birthday, I come home from work and shes at my house and I was excited because at first she wasnt able to because of family issues but she was able to see me on my birthday. I'm so happy right? Then after I shower and lay down in bed with her and want to ask her if she wants do anything for the night, her phone goes off with the text ""when do you leave his house so I can see you again?"" And I asked her about it and it just turned into the biggest scream fest ever, woke the neighbors up and everything. She told me I was controlling and toxic. So I said okay no ive given you 3 chances and I'm done. This is ridiculous. So now here I stand, broken up on my birthday, thinking I did what was best for my mental health getting away from her. But. For some retarded reason. I miss everything. I miss coming home to someone, someone to take a shower with, someone to laugh with during 2am car rides with music, someone to talk to throughout the day, someone to be a reason I push to be a better person every day. She broke me down in so many ways, yet I miss being with her. But at the same time I know I had to get away from it. I blocked her on everything, and deleted everything because after 6yrs of me trying to be the best i could be, trying to make a life with her, temporary validation was better. And im torn by that. Every. Single. Day.

One issue we’ve been having is she keeps wanting to hang out with her ex just because he gives her attention. She’s lied to me a few times about being with him and I always let it go because I love her.

Last night she was drinking with her friends and blacked out. She was flirting with her ex all night and then went into his room with him. He leaned in to kiss her and she kissed him back, but he took that as a sign to fuck her. He took her pants off and fucked her and she tried to get away. I’m so angry at him for this, but I don’t know how to feel about her.

Like, she did kiss him willingly, isn’t that cheating? I feel too bad though because he then fucked her even though she claims she tried to get away.

1847,"How can I support my partner that was sexually assaulted by his bio dad? Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

My (25f) fiancé (26m) was sexually assaulted by his biological father (I’ll call him Rob) as a kid. He can’t remember how old he was but he knows he was very young. He can remember going to a relatives house for a sleepover and Rob came home very drunk, climbed into his bed, and touched him. My fiancé doesn’t think Rob remembers anything, but this same event happened on two separate occasions. 

My fiancé’s parents split before he was born and so Rob never raised my fiancé and doesn’t have much of a relationship with him to this day. I’m the first and only person my fiancé has confided in about the assaults, minus his mom who he told as a child and she didn’t believe him. 

Reddit family, I’m really struggling to cope. I love this guy more than anything and I see the long-term impacts of this assault, especially as a man in society. His confidence and self-esteem is so low and he blames himself for what happened. I know this is common, and he’s sought counselling already. But… I badly want to tell his family what Robs done. I want him to have the support of his family, but instead they love and praise Rob and sorta leave my fiancé disconnected from the family since he doesn’t have a relationship with his bio dad. I also have a hard to believing Rob doesn’t remember what he did… a drunk action like that has to have been at least a sober thought, right?

My fiancé doesn’t want to tell his family because he doesn’t want them to hate Rob. He is afraid they won’t believe him and it’ll bring stress into the family. And I know it’s not my story to tell, but I’m afraid one day I’ll break and won’t be able to keep it to myself any longer. If I’m being honest, it drives me crazy to know that he doesn’t have to suffer any of the consequences for what he’s done yet the person I love suffers and will continue to suffer so much.

I have one girl and one boy and they are all close in age so they are all best friends. My problem is that my sister in law can be quite a mess in her personal life and is very immature for being almost 50. I found out a few weeks ago that my 5 year old son was splashing in the hot-tub and when asked to stop he didn’t so my sister in law maliciously dunked his head underwater and it made him very upset and he cried hard. It made my blood boil when I heard about it. She was supposed to be supervising so no one drowned and she does this?  This isn’t the first time she’s done something like this either. A few years ago we were at an outdoor family function and my daughter (4 at the time)  was playing with her kids and when a ball came in her direction she went to get it and my sister in law outright pushed her to the ground in order for her own daughter to be able to reach it first. It was intentional and not playful at all. I saw the whole thing and right when my sister in law did it she looked right at me because she knew she messed up and I saw it. My daughter started bawling and came to me saying “aunt **** pushed me” these “incidences” make my blood boil but my sister in law will just apologize and brush it under the rug while I’m left feeling frustrated and like a pissed off mama bear. I love and take care of her kids like they are my own and I would never do the same things to her kids. The problem lies in the fact that she’s literally on the same street as me and our kids are best friends plus they go to school together, so they like to play any chance they get. I’ve mentioned moving to my husband but I do feel like taking them away from their cousins would be depriving them of those relationships and the housing climate in my state isn’t super friendly right now. I’ve spoken to her about it in depth and I end up feeling like I’m the adult chastising a child, because I do not think these are normal incidences for an adult to have with young children.

2037,"I 28M stayed with my GF 27F for over a year after she allowed her friend to cancel me publicly online. A year ago, my GF of 3 years abandoned me when I needed her care and support. (I work social media as a early career while she works social media as her career for over 10 years.) I was getting cancelled by a group in the community over bullshit reasons. (A person was stealing my original art and content for over a year and posting as their own and getting the recognition for it. I was getting frustrated over this and briefly spoke out on the issue asking for others advice on how to handle it not naming names. The thieves caught on. Since everyone is a piece of shit obsessed with their internet fame, they struck first by publicly making up a fake narrative about me, formed a group of friends that would lie for her and back her, and then tried to cancel me. Internet is a shit ass place.)

I normally wouldn't care much about ""canceling""... But one of the group attacked my personal life. Personal life is where I draw the line.

One of the people in the group was one of my GF's friends. This friend contacted my GF and was trying to convince her to break up with me (saying things such as I was abusive, crazy, unhinged, inferred rape... and that she would call someone to check in on her safety physically... anything she could say to manipulate my GF.) This person was internet friends with me for over a year, but never met me in person.... Her behavior was a sharp 180.

My GF didn't defend me, she more played neutral. She came to me and showed me the conversation (she was frustrated and shocked by what the friend was saying.) My GF said she just wanted to collect info and not cause more issues, although I knew this was a lie she told me cuz she was just not wanting to have an awkward situation where she had to defend me and shut down her friend. I asked why she would continuously let her friend talk about me in such a harsh way, and it makes our relationship look and feel like a joke by allowing it. I was hurt.

My GF realized I was right, but flustered she went back to her conversation with her friend and kinda stood up for me. After she was done, my GF came back to me and got mad at me for ""bringing drama into my (her) life and making me (her) lose a friend."" Some friend to want whos willing to lie to ruin your relationship all for the sake of cancel culture, right? 

I realized this dynamic between me and my GF was bad for us. I tried to address the issue the next day. I said it was bad that we didnt work together during this situation, and what if something happens in the future, will we just get stressed and attack eachother again? In which her response was a shut down- ""What are you plaining on brining more drama into my life in the future? I never had drama in my life before I was with you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I didnt know how to take this. Already the original issue was affecting me emotionally and I needed someone to be behind me. She wasnt. It felt like being punched repeatedly in the gut by these people online, and then having my GF step on my throat while I was at it. It was more weird that initially before the friend contacted her, my GF was on my side, but the moment she had a chance to be held accountable for her support, she broke and attacked me.

&amp;#x200B;

I stuck around with my GF after this for over a year. But I never got over this problem. MY love for her was damaged now. I honestly could not look at her the same way after this. When I would sleep in the same bed with her, I would look at her and laugh to myself is the saddest most betrayed, most state of disbelief manner. I tried to address it multiple times, but each time she wrote it off as not being such a big deal. It never got settled for me. I began to feel I could not really rely on her (Can someone tell me if this is a fair feeling?) 

I feel like a moron for having stayed with her for so long after this. I wanted to love her and correct things, but instead there was problem after problem after problem. This situation I wrote about was the beginning of where my heart shifted and gort much more defensive in the relationship. I knew right when this issue happened, I should've left her, but I stayed in misery for over a year.

Can anyone talk me through some of this? I feel so off and empty now.",0
2525,"Business partner insists on pointing out every minor mistake, cannot let anything go. (Both M/40s) This is a bit of a strange situation, but I'll try to be as detailed as possible.  


I am considering leaving a position that I've loved for years because there's just too much toxicity for me to handle. This small business has 3 partners, myself included. We've worked at this for years and have been fairly successful. My work has always been outstanding, and my loyalty and enthusiasm has been top-notch, and I have been told this by both of them. I've given nearly a decade of my life and dedication to this job.   


One of the partners (Partner A) I get along with extremely well. He's just a regular, down to earth guy, has his flaws and knows it, and essentially doesn't let the small stuff bother him about others. He understands that people have their quirks and that sometimes that comes with the territory of a good, creative worker. The other guy is polar opposite and is making me hate being here.  


The other partner (Partner B) in question cannot let ANYTHING go. Any ""t"" which is not crossed will elicit a message to me. It also goes in our personal lives. We're friends outside of work, and if I'm 10 minutes late, or if I left a coffee ring on his counter, or whatever....I'll hear about it. Sometimes, it'll even come up a week later because he ruminated on it for so long, no longer able to restrain himself from bringing it up.  


Recently, a project emerged in which I was put in a place where success was nearly impossible given the limited resources I had. Partner A had a meeting with me and expressed concern that I was behind on the work, said it was not the best work I'd done, but was certain we could get it up to speed and wanted to devise a plan to get it done. After I explained my side of things, he agreed and didn't really hold the lower quality of work against me, admitting that I had not been given the time or resources I needed. Partner A approached me with one of the worst, most insulting and hurtful dressing-down sessions I have ever endured in my 30 year long career. I was told I angered him, made him regret the fact that I was even here, etc. Mind you, again, in 10 years, nothing like this has EVER happened with me, and he agrees my work has ALWAYS been outstanding.   


I was so incredibly hurt and then furious that I was put in this position, and then approached this way without any benefit of the doubt, or without any civil ""Hey, I notice something is going on that is not like you"" talk first. This sort of overreaction, accusatory, sanctimonious crap has gone on for years and I am tired of it. Even after bringing up my side of it, and him agreeing with much of what I said, he STILL then said, ""I still stand by everything I said, though."" Absolutely not willing to concede that things were not really what they seemed.  


I am considering leaving this situation that I have been in for a decade. I am extremely marketable and have been offered work at other places by industry people who know me and my work, and am not really worried about being out of a job. 

The really big question I have here is: how do I express myself and show this person what they're doing to me (and others) that is hurting himself and his business? What do you call this sort of behavior? I want to be civil, and try to maintain a good relationship, but I am at a point where I cannot be silent about it anymore and need to tell him how he has made me feel all these years. Ironically, it's now I who cannot hold it in any longer...but this would really be my first time in contrast to his many dozens of times.",0

219,"Stepdaughter was assaulted follow up. I appreciate everyone's advice from my original post. She had to go to the police station for follow up questions. While there she asked for my wife to leave the room. She told the detective she was assaulted again in Jan of 2019. I was not part of her life yet at this time so I don't know the details completely, but this was a few months after her grandfather passed away. She made my wife leave, but ended up telling the exact same story, she went out walking and someone assaulted her.

Well at that time they lived practically in the middle of no where, with very few people around. I'm not saying it didn't happen, but this is all starting to sound a little far fetched. The detectives have reviewed very clear surveillance footage for 2 days around the time of the recent incident, and have not seen her in any part of the video. When she was told this, she changed her story to she walked a different way, after she already was very clear and sure she went the way that passed right by the cameras.

I don't know what to do at this point, but now CPS is going to get involved. 

TLDR: stepdaughter(15) told some friends she was assaulted august 19, ended up having to give a police statement. She has absolutely refused getting a rape examination done, but did do a pregnancy and STD test. Went to the police this morning for follow up questions, told them she was assaulted in Jan 2019. Police reviewed surveillance for recent incident and did not see her walking where she said, she changed her story after being told that.",1

Me 25M girlfriend 23F (at the time)  

*A little over 25 years ago, I found the woman of my dreams we will call her Mary. We did everything together, she learned to love my passions like SCUBA diving and fishing. She was beautiful,* *smart* *and funny. After about a year we moved in together (more or less, I still kept* *my own place but stayed at her place more often than not), life was great in fact I was thinking about asking her to marry me. Then... she started to act distant, I was getting the Heisman in bed, and she started to want “alone time”, picking B.S. fights.*  ***\*\*\*ALWAYS BE MINDFUL OF RED FLAGS\*\*\**** *even if she tells you, it’s not in your head. I started to talk to my best friend Billy every night about what was happening and how I was thinking it was another man, and what I was trying to do to find out. After trying for a long time to catch her I gave up, and moved on. I ended up moving to another city about 2 hours away with a much better job.  Then one day out of the blue, Mary reconnects with me, we chat for hours and hours over days and weeks (think of Forrest Gump, “we were like peas and carrots”) she* *comes* *to visit, it goes well, so she moves in with me and finds a job. Things are going so well we start to look for a nicer apartment and again I was thinking about popping the question.  I was in the process of thinning things out, pitching out the junk to make the move easier. She drove up to see her folks (two-hour drive) I had to work the next day so I did not go. I went back to pitching out things. I got to a pile of partially used legal pads and notebooks, flipped through them to make sure nothing I was not pitching out anything important. I opened a notebook, like the ones in school with a black and white binder, it was Mary’s journal. I read it, every single sordid word. I was absolutely crushed, I went into the bathroom and puked. (It’s* *been 25 years and I can still feel the pain) I hardly know where to start, she was having a nonstop sexual affair with my best friend Billy, with every sexual detail you can imagine down to the taste of our cum. Her and Billy were laughing at me about how he knew* *every single thing I was doing to catch them. It all falls into place, that is the reason I never caught him; I was telling my every move to the guy that was Fucking my girl. A few months after our breaking up, (still completely in the dark) I started to notice that Billy was very...very distant, for example I was not invited to a BBQ held at Billy’s house, which I thought was odd but I went anyway.*  *When I walked in, they acted like they had seen a ghost, and few were bumping their elbows to each other and were chuckling to themselves. I saw Mary there (which was not a shock as we ran with the same crowd) In hindsight Billy looked uncomfortable but at the time I played it off as maybe he thought he forgot to invite me and felt bad.... I did not stay long as the place had a weird vibe going on. \*\*more red flags\*\* In large part I was ostracized from my (what I thought) friends (still in the dark) so much so that I never said goodby to any of them when I moved.*  

*After reading her journal, I made copies: one set for me, one set for Mary’s parents, one set for Billy’s current wife and his parents, and left a set on top of the pile of her things by the front door. I put a note in saying: she has 24hrs to pack and leave, otherwise I will call the police. (My name is on the lease) My phone blew up and I did not answer. My voicemail was filled with: “I love you, you are my best friend, that was in the past, you are the love of my life... etc..etc.. And more etc...*  

*At the end of my note on top of her things it said: I will never be someone’s plan B.* 

*Fast forward 20+ years, happy married to a woman that adores me with grown kids.*

2548,"I told my bf how I feel and he just got upset I(19F) told my boyfriend(22M) that I feel down sometimes bc he doesn’t do anything nice/spontaneous for me and I’d like maybe some flowers sometimes or even small acts of kindness every once in a while. We’ve been together 2 and 1/2 years and he’s never bought me a gift for my birthday or Christmas. One time for my birthday he bought himself a new PlayStation but didn’t have any money after that to get me a gift (he got me a Halloween gift basket last year tho) and he’s never bought me flowers before. Every couple weeks I’ll get paid and go on shopping and I always get something for him. A small gift or maybe something he mentioned he wanted recently. But he’s only ever done that for me a couple times in our relationship. The only other time he’s done something nice was when we were fighting and he’s trying to make up for it. Today I told him how I feel and that I’d appreciate something small to show he thinks about me. It could be as small as loading a bowl (we smoke weed) for me when I get home from work (which I do for him nearly every day) but he responded saying that every gf he’s had at one point or another has said something similar. And he said he’s sorry for not being good at showing love and we kinda joked about it and I thought we were good. But seconds later he says “well great, now I feel like shit” and hands me his debit card so he won’t spend money on something else. He usually spends his money on a random thing for himself. Like last month he bought himself a bow and arrow and crossbow, but he didn’t pay the gas bill for 2months so I had to pay it for him (we split the bills. The gas is his) and he even makes more money than I do. 

I can’t believe he got upset at me for telling him how I feel. We just sat in silence for a couple minutes until he went back to work. Now I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong. I don’t think I’m asking for too much but now I feel bad for saying anything at all.",0

3061,"My (30sF) FWB/casual partner (40sM) told me to tell him if I have a MFM threesome without him **TLDR - I had one glass too many last night and texted this person I’ve been casually seeing about considering a MFM threesome (not actually interested but someone asked me). We are allowed to do whatever we want, but I’m concerned he’s uncomfortable. He *seemed* uncomfortable but idk if I was reading too much into it. I feel a bit trapped - I kind of want to have a real conversation to clear the air about what we do outside of our “relationship” since he seemed uncomfortable and I care for him as a friend but the only real rule of this “relationship” is there are no rules.**

I’m guessing this might be difficult for some people to understand but I’m currently at a point in my life where I havé eschewed all commitment. I don’t want a boyfriend or a husband, I just like companionship when I want it and solitude the rest of the time. I am very happy, though most of my friends don’t understand as they are all in committed, monogamous relationships. 

I’ve been seeing this guy for a few months now, and he’s much the same as me. We meet up maybe once a month for a few days in a fun location, hang out, then go back to our real lives. When we are together, we do act like a couple, it’s not just sex, and we get along really well. I consider him something like a friend. We text nearly every day we are apart. About books, our lives, and yes, sex - usually sexting each other, messages of what we’d like to try next time we see each other, mutual masturbation. We are allowed to see other people, but his preference is we don’t talk about it. Neither of us can commit more than this. Honestly I find this set up perfect for me, but I recognize it has a built in but unknown end date. That feels oddly reassuring to me, which is hard to explain. 

I got a little buzzed last night. I was feeling good and when I came home from a date and I messaged him about our plans for a MFF threesome. 

In the middle of these messages, I let slip I had been propositioned for a MFM threesome recently. 

Tbh I’m adventurous and love to try new things but I feel like a MFM threesome would be me trying it for the sake of trying it, and idk if that’s the stance I want to have when it comes to something sexual. In other words, at this point it’s unlikely something I want to do but it was kind of cool the opportunity has presented itself. 

* He immediately replied: “What a flattering proposition. Did you take him up on it?”

* Me: “I haven’t decided. He was cute but I haven’t met the friend” 

* Him: “Let me know what you decide”

Idk this set off an alarm bell even in my alcohol clouded mind. 

* Me: “Lmao why”

* Him: “I want to know!”

* Him: “:)”

* Me: “I thought our policy was don’t ask don’t tell”

* Me: “but okay if you insist”

* Me: “Anyway it’s unlikely. I’m small and I don’t want to die of internal bleeding thx”

* Him: “😂😂”

I went to bed feeling fine and then today I woke up super anxious, which is probably my only hangover symptom today but I wish I had asked him if he preferred I didn’t? 

There are a few ways I am ok with our situation changing:

* one of us starts actually dating someone else

* one of us doesn’t want to do this anymore

* one of us wants to be exclusive and the other does not etc. 

But to lose his companionship over something like this would be dumb IMO - a threesome I don’t even want to have. Yes - my brain jumped from “hmm maybe I overstepped a boundary” to “now he’s gonna leave” which is definitely anxiety talking and I’m not normally like that. 

I think perhaps to him my life sounds more wild than it actually is - even in my vague descriptions of it to him. I’m social, I go out frequently, I date (I don’t mention this part), but the actual number of people I sleep with is low. I actually have only slept with one other person since meeting him. Even though I am totally okay with casual sex I tend to take a bit of time before hopping into bed with people - he doesn’t know that though. It’s never came up and he was somewhat of an exception - I first slept with him on date 1 haha. 

To me he can do whatever he likes as long as he’s safe about it. And he’s essentially told me the same, but then moments like the above happen and idk if I’m reading too much into it but I felt like he was uncomfortable or perhaps silently judging (maybe that’s just me? I was uncomfortable and then I wondered if he was judging me which made me turn a critical lens on myself haha). Perhaps I crossed the first line by doing what he said he would prefer not to hear: bringing up details of my sexual life outside of him. 

Anyway - anyone with experience with open, I’ll-defined relationships? I care about him and he cares about me - we have both said we view each other as more than just a hook up but neither of us wants more than this. Should I have a conversation about this or am I just anxious and should let this blow over, let him bring it up if it matters to him that much?",0
2093,"Is my (26f) boyfriend (30m) lying about having fertility issues? Hi everyone,

First can I ask you tell you please not judge me?

I’m convinced that my (26f) boyfriend (30m) of a year and a half is a narcissist. Just for context.

I’m currently in the middle of getting out of the relationship. This has just been really messing with my head and I’m desperate to know the truth. It would also be the final nail in the coffin that gives me that extra push to leave and stay gone.

About a year ago, we got into a heated argument over discussing having a baby in the future. I told him I wasn’t comfortable with it because our relationship is rocky. Then he suddenly brought up the fact that he has a low sperm count.

He proceeded to tell me that he gets checked for it every 6 months, and his younger brother (26) has the same issue. Keep in mind that he got a girl pregnant once when he was 19. He also goes back and forth from saying he has a low sperm count to saying that he has issues with sperm mobility (when I know the correct term is motility).

The thing is, as far as I know, he hasn’t been to a doctor in the whole year and a half we’ve been together (and we talk about our day every day). Furthermore, I don’t understand why he’d have his sperm checked in the first place since he’s never intentionally tried to have a baby and he’s still young. Let alone his younger brother. Then the fact his story keeps changing (he insisted that he never said his brother has the same issue and called me delusional) and 
all the other evidence, I can’t help but doubt him.

I told him I’d believe him if he went to a doctor and took me with him. He agreed. Mind you, he’s doubled down (and worse) on ridiculous lies before (including that he saw a toddler fall from a 5 story window and walk away unharmed).

Tl;dr manipulative boyfriend might be lying about fertility issues to get me pregnant as a control tactic

2311,"boyfriend broke up with me because he doesn’t want anything serious right now I dated this guy from May- August 2020 and in august of last year he decided to break things off because our relationship was overwhelming him. I was really emotionally and needed to chill out a bit more and he needed to be more understanding and communicate his feelings more. We still saw each other while we were broken up, as we intended to get back together. In reality, we did everything during that time that we would in a relationship: hangout, have sleepovers, go on dates, etc. I met and hung out with his friends and got to know his brothers in his frat. Things finally got better between us and we started to date in April 2021 again. From there on things have been really great with little problems. I have since met his parents and stayed at his house over the summer, met and hung out with his friends back home, and we were together for at least a consecutive week twice over the course of the summer. I had joked about us getting a shared bunny, and he thought that could be a cool idea. So we went ahead and went half on an adorable little Holland lop. Just last night I got the stomach turning text “we need to talk” and when I went over to his place he said that he’s scared that everything is just getting too serious for him and he’s just not ready so he broke up with me. He said that his parents keep talking about his future with me and so do his friends and it just stresses him out and overwhelms him because he’s not ready for any next steps. Getting a rabbit also stressed him out after the fact once he realized how big of a step that was. He said that he spends a lot of his time with me and sometimes blows off other obligations to be with me and even though that’s not my fault, it’s just not what he wants right now. He also says that since we’re juniors in college and that things are gonna change soon and he’s not ready to plan his future around someone else. I understand where he’s coming from with this but I don’t understand why we had to break up over it. Especially since he still wants to see me, told me he loves me, and promised that we would get back together again. He’s never broken a promise but I’m just confused, is he just taking time to reevaluate his future ? I genuinely don’t think he’s doing this to see other people. I asked and he said that he doesn’t want anyone else and that he’s not looking. He said hes not going to delete any pictures or have me get rid of the stuff I keep in his apartment. He says I’m still gonna come over and hang out with his friends and I don’t think he would do that if he was trying to get with other people. And when I asked him if I should take off the bracelet with his initial on it, he said it was up to me but made me promise to not throw it away. 

I’m very confused as to why we had to break up but I’m also confused as to what to do about it. Please don’t say things like oh it’s for the best because I’m taking this really hard and he means the world to me.",0
151,"Our toddler is defiant, hits and pulls hair! I'm at a loss... Our sweet little guy is 14.5 months old and generally a pretty happy little dude, he's quite smart and picks things up fairly quickly (we've already got him pooping on the potty 95% of the time!) Recently he's been really entering into toddlerhood, he's not yet walking but very close !

Over a month or so ago he started hitting us.. first was just me and then started to become Dada as well and occasionally Grandma or others. He always hits the face, chest or pulls hair. I usually calmy but sternly say no, no hitting, or ow that hurts or gentle-nice touching and show him to touch gently. But he doesn't seem to get it...I think he thinks it's a game because he'll either do it over and over or gets this smirk on his face when you say no or grab his hand to stop him, and sometimes laughs!

I've also tried not reacting, or removing myself from the situation but that's not always possible and seems to make no difference because he does this multiple times a day.

Hes also extremely defiant! Like knows when he will get a negative reaction (ie no don't do that, or yucky, etc) for instance if he's unhappy with you or in a mood, he will grab a piece of food off his tray, look u dead in the eye and put it over the edge, wait for you to react and then sometimes let it drop. Or earlier today he grabbed something off the ground outside (a pinecone) looked at me and put it to his mouth knowing he's not suppose to...waiting for me to react.


I know this is relatively normal but I just don't know how best to handle it and how to curb this behavior. My patience are starting to dwindle and a couple times I've grabbed his hand a little too hard that he cried... I feel awful but I just don't know how else to show him that he can't smack me in the face over and over, or grab my hair and pull really hard. 

Please help! Any experience or advice would be super appreciated!!",1
3013,"Direction in a relationship Is it to early after two months to discuss the direction a relationship is heading? I'm in a long distance relationship and we'll see for about 2-3 months a year (different colleges).

But the relationship is new. I'll like to ask where we are headed. And what expectations we both have. I really wouldn't want to waste my time if it's going to be just casual. But is it to soon to bring this up after two months. I don't to freak her out.

And if it isn't too early, give me hints on how to phrase the 'we need to talk' message. Our conversations start up playfully and it's hard to get serious. I intend sending a text today to make it clear that it's a serious conversation tommorow (she has tests today, but will be free tomorrow).

1591,"Fell in love with someone who cheated with me Long story short.. I (27m) fell in love with my best friend (28f) who has been in a relationship for 9 years (engaged for 3). Dude’s a POS, has cheated on her, demeans and belittles her, doesn’t support her, hasn’t worked for over 1.5y and let’s her drown in their bills while she works her ass off. We got closer and ended up sleeping together multiple times and she ‘started to fall in love with me’ as I did her. I fell a lot harder apparently. I took care of her, did everything for her. Fed her, took her on dates consistently, got her anything she wanted, took her to do whatever she wanted. I always made sure she was good in every way possible. After over a year of this, she decides to stay with him and and ‘work’ on their relationship and says she needs to focus on them instead because it was all a mistake. I’m obviously super heart broken and it’s quite unbearable. I’ve given her more of myself than anyone else in 27y of my life. I’m constantly tarnished by other people because I seem obsessed because it looks one-sided. We’ve kept everything a secret from our friends and coworkers and family for her sake. I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m broken and lost and tired of having to live through her lies to preserve who people think she is. I lost my best friend. My soul mate. Someone who I’d give the world to. I don’t know what advice I’m looking for exactly.. maybe how to cope?

1396,"5 year old is extremely annoying We have a 5 year old boy who can be extremely obnoxious and annoying, especially in the morning when he first wakes up. It seems like he experiments with different noises, sounds and words until he finds the ones that annoy us.

Then he repeats them. Again. And again.

And again.

It's gotten to the point where it's causing us a great deal of stress. Another thing that he does is roll all over and climb on my wife while she is sleeping. She works nights so she definitely isn't happy with it. No matter how many times we ask (sometimes yell) for him to stop he just continues doing it, thinking it is funny.

This isn't a non stop thing all day. Most of the time he is usually pretty well behaved. The behavior seems to come out when he's bored or when he wants something. We don't give him what he wants when he acts like that. We wait until he stops.

Has anyone dealt with this issue before? How did you curve the behavior? Is this just a phase he will grow out of?",1

My partner’s original number was 9, my  maximum, but I accepted it. I have since been told by them that the true number is 11.

186,"How was school and home when you went back to work (after being a SAHP)? I've been a SAHM for ten years now. My youngest is starting Kindergarten next week and I'm very anxious to try and get back into the workforce.

I've fully accepted that I'll be starting at the bottom somewhere. I'm going for a part-time, Monday through Friday office position so I can be home when my kids get home from school and on weekends.

I hated calling in sick when I was working before..I always felt bad for leaving them short-handed. So naturally, I'm dreading the thought of having to leave mid-shift because the office calls and needs me to pick one up. Or having to call off a shift last minute because of a snow day, or one of my kids had to stay home sick, or having to quit on them if things have to go back to online learning if there's another COVID outbreak.

Then there's the question of what we would do during holiday breaks, spring break, and next summer when school is out. My grandparents watched my brother and I after school and during summer breaks, but I don't want to ask the same of my parents (I don't think they're capable and I'd feel bad taking so much of their time).

My partner (M22) and I did not have a clear conversation about breaking up, but instead left things open. Is this okay? As stated, I recently moved out of state, and I was in a three year monogamous relationship with a partner who I lived with. While we never had a clear conversation about what would happen when I moved, it was understood that we were not going to engage in a long distance relationship. He helped me move and when he left we expressed to each other that we are best friends and would always love each other. He left, and we still talk regularly on the phone and via text and tell each other we love each other. My close friend thinks that this is unacceptable behavior and that we need to have a conversation about where we are. She is afraid that he is more invested in anything between us than me, and that my circumstances are better, so that it is unfair of me to not initiate this conversation, even though I don't have a clear idea of where I want this to go (we have considered him moving in with me, depending on what happens with classes this fall).

871,"Trading the ""American Dream"" for a better connection with nature I'm originally from New England area but basically raised in the desert. I've got a pretty great life with my wife and 3 awesome kids (ages 1-8). We live in an amazing community - like, our city is often on lists of best places to raise kids and the community within that city is very tightknit (lots of parks, lots of kids out and about, 5 star schools...). The kids are involved in a lot of activities (arguably too many right now) and live close to their cousins and good friends. 

It all sounds like a perfect situation, but...

I hate the desert. I miss living where it rains, living near the ocean, fishing, trees, cold. I'm sure I'm somewhat romanticizing my memories as a child and the short trips I've taken throughout my life back to the east coast (or pacific NW, NorCal...). Maybe I'm not thinking as honestly about how sick of the cold/rain I may get.

But I feel like my mental health is very much negatively affected by a disconnect from nature. We mostly hide away in our home for 4 months out of the year due to the heat while pumping $300/month of a/c into the place. I don't care about the money, but the environmental consequences really bother me. I don't think people should have ever moved to the desert if it couldn't sustain life in a more environmentally friendly way. Maybe you can just substitute furnace for a/c and say cold climates can be just as bad? I don't know, but I've felt an increasingly stronger pull towards a greener, cooler climate for years. 

I honestly believe a huge factor in my mental wellbeing is needing to reconnect with nature (which I equate with that particular climate). I feel like a move could ultimately benefit the entire family. Maybe we've bought into the ""America Dream"" too much - where we keep busy constantly, always with something to do, people to see. I bump into people I've known 20+ years constantly when I'm out, which is awesome. But is it maybe too much? 

**Sorry to be so long-winded. I guess I'm asking...**

*Anyone else felt this way? So connected to a specific climate that you thought of/did uproot your family to get there?*

*Felt like, although you have built/provided your family with a great life, you may have ""Americanized/westernized"" everything too much? And though it might seem almost cruel, took them out of an environment that some might argue is perfect?* 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe we need to take more trips but that gets exhausting and expensive. Maybe this is all escapism. Maybe I'm being self-absorbed. Maybe I need to just find better ways to connect to my current environment.",0
1707,"Adjustment from living together to seperately My partner (23f) and I(25f) were living together from may-sept this year because at the time her mom was being very controlling and she’s a closeted homophobe. At this time we’ve been together for two years and I decided to let her know that she can move into my house with my family to escape her toxic environment. Living together in my room wasn’t ideal but it was the best decision we came up with and I told her she could always move out once she gets her finances settled(she’s a new grad nurse) so if she ever felt like she was stuck she could move out. Although, during the summer I decided I wanted to move out with her and we planned on doing that searching for apartments, but then my family said that they wouldn’t be able to afford living in a rented house if I move out because I pay partial rent(in the time she was with me she was also paying rent). Thus in the end we decided to stay, but around august she decided that it would be better if she moved out by herself so she can feel more comfortable in her environment not having to live with my whole family which was understandable(but because of my abandonment issues and my immigrant mentality of equating love with sacrifice i felt as if she didn’t love me anymore because she wouldn’t sacrifice living with me for a year until we can move out together). But i quickly resolved that feeling and communicated that with her and knew that just because she was moving out doesn’t mean she does not love me anymore. Now fast forward to this week, she moved out last sunday and the 2 weeks leading up to her moving out were so difficult for the both of us. We aren’t used to fighting because we both avoid conflict and aren’t the type of people to have arguments. We fought constantly about the dumbest shit in which resulted afterwards in us not even knowing in the end what we were fighting about. In the last night of her staying with me I was in so much distraught because we got into little arguments throughout the day because of her just having these angry outbursts towards me(which i’m not used to bc she’s very laid back). Laying in bed(high af) I asked her if she wanted to break up because I wasn’t used to this part of her and I don’t want to be treated as if I’m not someone she doesn’t love. And she breaks down crying saying she’s been overwhelmed with having to move by herself and me telling her before that I couldn’t help her move(i ended up helping her move bc i understood where she was coming from) made her feel neglected and not supported basically triggered her bc all her life her parents did that to her. (I have been in therapy this whole summer because of my own traumas, and I feel like I’m doing my part in trying to heal and become a better person to myself and others) She cried to me that night(tues night) about how she sees how her parents are(toxic) and the past week she saw that in the way she was treating me, and how angry she has become all the time bc she feels like she has ocd. I brought up breaking up because I also felt like she was unhappy in our relationship bc she was constantly nitpicking at the things i did, and she told me that all these unresolved traumas are resurfacing but she’s going to try to never make me feel like that again. She said in her exact words “i know we can do this it’s just more apparent now how hard it will be but i want to stay together” and “this is just a test if i can be in a relationship with u and still heal and work on myself” because i also told her that i’m willing to stay but the next time it happens i’m breaking up with her. Now it’s friday and I still feel off. I feel heart broken, like there’s a thing in my chest ready to burst. It could be the adjustment of not living together anymore(first week) and me having to go back to nursing school(hell). She feels the same way bc it brought up a lot of issues within her and feels like she can’t be the same. Anyways the point of this whole thing is to see if this a normal thing couples go through. It’s been hard but we decided to be together and work it all out. I also need to stop threatening to breakup every time there’s a difficult thing we’re going through. I’ve just been feeling weird and i don’t know if it’s normal to feel this way after one of the very few biggest(intense?) fight we’ve ever had.",0

So to preface this I have been with my boyfriend for 5 years and through out this relationship he has kept this hard drive mostly for torrented movies and shows to watch on laptops/tv and for backups when one of us has been changing devices. It’s usually plugged in the tv for me to watch series that I have asked him to download. 
A few weeks ago I plugged the hard drive into my laptop to retrieve some files as I had changed devices and he got really angry at me saying I should have asked first and that it’s still his private thing. I apologised but was confused since it had been fine me accessing it the past several years. I tried to put it out of my mind but it was odd. Today I was looking through to try and find a show he had recently downloaded for me and I know I shouldn’t have but I snooped. Yes I know I am wrong for that and he deserves privacy but it that incident had left me feeling so suspicious and weird about it.

I’m currently 7 months pregnant with our second son (our first is 4) and I’m having trouble wrapping my head around the fact that my MIL straight up refuses to get vaccinated. We’re being told by my OB and our sons pediatrician that we should hold out on unvaccinated visitors until the baby is at least 4 months. 
My husband broke the news to his Mom today and essentially begged her to reconsider her stance - she replied by showing him printed out studies that wrongly imply that all the vaccines contain “aborted babies” aka stem cell research. She’s extremely religious but in the worst sort of way - she picks and chooses scenarios to throw her martyrdom around. My husband tried to explain that she could get the Pfizer or Moderna (both of which don’t involve “aborted babies”) and she went off on a different tangent about how COVID is being overplayed for the sake of “one World order”. It’s madness. She’s saying that we can’t trust the government, the sources we use are biased, we don’t actually read the REAL news etc. Every anti-vaxx argument you can imagine. It seems we’re at a stalemate. She lives 10 minutes away and is very involved in our toddler sons life but it seems like all of that is about to change.

2022,"Please help! Any advice/opinion is needed! My ex called me

So we dated for 4 1/2 years and 3 months after the breakup he got a girlfriend… anyways we’ve always kinda been on and off with contact for random reasons. 

So a week ago He texted me asking about what a game I used to play with him was called and I was out to eat and didn’t answer because I just didn’t even really know why he was texting me.. and then an hour later he FaceTimed me after I didn’t text him back… I answer and asked if I can call him back later because im out to eat.. 

He says yes I can but he was just wondering if he could get his tux jacket back (it’s at my house) and if it’s gonna be super late then to just not worry about it and I told him I’d just call him later. He then proceeds to say to me “I like your gold necklaces by the way and I like your earrings too” and I was like thank you. And then I told him I have to go and I’d call him later.  

So I get home and I am not busy anymore..

So I FaceTimed him and he didn’t answer and then two minutes later he called me back and told me he was dropping off a friend and that he would call me after.. then he called me back but I don’t know why he thought he needed to return my call to tell me that he could’ve just dropped his friend off and then called me back.

anyways he was like “hey what’s up how are you” and I kind of just talked about what we did today and then he was like who’s all over at your house right now and I told him who was and then we got into more conversation about a concert that’s going on in our city. 

Then we somehow got into the conversation of just kind of like getting on each other‘s asses like he made fun of me for getting my ears pierced so much and then I was like at least I didn’t need to hold your hand when I got a shot because he used to be afraid of needles and squeeze my hand so hard when he got a shot and then he was like at least I didn’t get braces multiple times and then I was like damn okay..  

Then he brought up (this is going to be TMI but I’m gonna say it) he brought up how I cried when he accidentally stuck his tip in my butt and it hurt really bad so I cried lol and I was thinking like woahhh this dude is bringing up a sexual encounter and then I was like yeahhh I’m surprised it caused me so much pain.. and he got what I meant and started laughing and then he was like “you look really pretty by the way I don’t know if anyone has told you that today….” And I was like thinking what the fuck… and then I told him I’ve been experimenting with my earrings LOL and kind of kept the conversation going I thanked him of course 

But I was like did he really just call me pretty and him getting on my ass is flirting when you bring a sexual encounter up .. (all while he has a gf) haha 

then he made a weird noise and was like I should probably hang up and I was like why?

I asked “Is there a reason why ?” and he said yeah and I was like OK why should you hang up ? and he was like I don’t want to be disrespectful and I asked “how would you be disrespectful ?” and he said “I’m getting these thoughts these bad thoughts and it wouldn’t be respectful to my girlf- “ and then he stopped saying girlfriend and said her name, I’m not sure why he did that …

And then I was like is talking to me disrespectful ? and he said no but the mindset I’m in it’s disrespectful I’m just getting these thoughts and they’re not good so I should probably hang up and then I was like “I respect that”. 

And then I told him about the tux we could figure something out. and then I asked him if he’s going to a mutual friends birthday party in September and he said he thinks he is it just depends on how school was and then I told him I’m probably going and then I said well have a nice night and then I hung up I don’t even know what he said back to me I just hung up.. 

After that the next day he sent me an old funny video of us singing and messing up and I just ignored it … he has sent another old memory of us too .. which is odd. 

In past conversations he has said things to me like “what we have/had is so effortless and so many people in the world try sooo hard to get what we have/had” and he said “whenever I talk to you or hang out with you I feel so grounded and calm” and just things like that, things you should be saying to your girlfriend, NOT YOUR EX… 

He claims he is over me and feels platonic about us.. but he is acting otherwise.. 

What is going on..? I’m so confused. Is his relationship not how he thought it would be? Is he not over me? He’s so hot and cold.. 

Any opinions would be helpful! :)",0

1375,"Speech Delay- How worried should I be? My 9 month old is still not babbling (only cooing, gurgling, and blowing raspberries). No gestures or imitation. Also responds to name inconsistently (like only when he’s not occupied with something). 

Other concerns are also a head lag while pulling to sit and lack of 3-point gaze. 

I spend every night stressing and doing research and it’s consuming me. 

I know he’s still relatively young and each baby is unique but... should I really start to mentally prepare myself and seek therapy early? Apparently early intervention is key for speech disorders, autism, etc.

2676,"Was I (22F) wrong for reaching out to fiancé's (26M) new female friend (20sF) about my insecurities with her? My fiancé and I have been together for a bit over a year now, got engaged on our one year anniversary. For essentially all of our relationship he has not really had friends and would ask me to spend time with him often. I on the other hand enjoy meeting new people and pursuing my own hobbies. I recently graduated from our university and had to move away from our small college town into city.

I understand all relationships are different but for our relationship, we are strict about what we can and cannot do with the opposite sex. We are not allowed to be alone with the opposite sex.

On Sunday he went to his apartment pool and just started talking to three different girls and a guy. He drove them to a grocery store there and back. My fiancé dropped off the guy first and then the girls.  He unloaded the girls' groceries in their apartment and then sat in their living room to chat with them. While nothing inappropriate happened, it was a something that crossed our set boundaries. I asked did he mention our relationship to them and he said no. I was really taken aback by it but I didn't want to fight about it. The girls asked him if he was possibly free to meet Tuesday which was the same say I was driving down to see him. I told him oh you can ask these girls if I can join and meet them since I am going to be in town. His response is where I went batshit insane because he told me, ""I don't want to tell them I have a fiancé yet because it would make our friendship weird.""

After he told me that I could not contain my anger and insecurities. I felt like he was hiding me from these new people because he didn't bother to bring up my existence and when I asked him to bring me up he refused. I was emotionally off the walls and cried all night on Monday. I am not going to lie this is where I went apeshit and found their phone numbers through our uni's student directory. I threatened him that if he didn't tell them he has a fiancé I will do it myself. He gave up and told them if I come into town we should all go bowling. My fiancé told me that he was forced to do something which is not okay in a relationship.

I drove down to see him and he told me he was too tired to discuss about our problems. I couldn't go through one more night of being this angry and insecure so I called one of the girls if we can meet the next day. She agreed and my fiancé found out about our scheduled call the next morning. He told me he doesn't want me to talk to her because it would make her feel uncomfortable. We eventually called and what I got from it was that there were indeed several topics he could have mentioned me. She asked me why I am calling her and I told her about how my fiancé didn't want to tell her about his engagement and I had to essentially force him to tell her. She thought it was really weird that he didn't want to mention me and told me that she doesn't want to be in the middle of any relationship issues, that she has only met him once, and does not mind ever meeting him again.

I told my fiancé about the phone call and he told me I am a horrible partner for sabotaging his friendships. He told me he can't make friends anymore because the Indian community in our town will find out about this and nobody will want to be close to him. He is upset that the girls he met don't want to text or meet up with him anymore. I told him if he never did any shady things, broke a boundary, or at least sit down and discuss with me about this, then I would have never done this. Reddit, was it wrong for me to do this?

TLDR; fiancé met a few girls, did some shady things (no cheating), refused to talk about them with me or resolve our problems. I reached out to one of the girls instead and she thought it was also weird how he's trying to maintain their friendship. They are no longer friends.",0

2927,"My [29/m] relationship [36/f] just started to be a long-distance one, but I'm not sure it is a good idea I have been in a relationship for one year now. We started dating about 1 year ago and soon started living together. I work in academia and I'm at a point in my career where I still need to move between different countries to get a job. I made this clear from the start and she promised she would move in with me.

6 months into the relationship, I got a job in the UK - we were based in France. Well, when the perspective of moving to a new country became real, my girlfriend back down. For good reasons, honestly - her whole life is and has always been in France. Nevertheless, this was a shock to me. I simply believed in her, that she understood the consequences of moving to a different country. Since then, the relationship started to fall apart. I became more distant, partly because of the stress of dealing with a move to the UK but also because I felt somehow that she betrayed me. Let me be clear - rationally, I understand her decision and I fully support it. But, emotionally, things are different. Emotionally, I feel like the one thing that I always warned her about wasn't being taken into full consideration.

Anyway, I moved to the UK one week ago. And I'm already feeling like this relationship isn't going to work. I have been in a long-distance relationship before - exactly the same circumstances - and I promised myself that I wouldn't do it again. It is simply too hard, and I cannot make it work. But here I am again in the same position. I want to break up with her. It simply doesn't make sense - I don't want to live in France (I'm not French, I was in France because of a job and I hated living there), and she doesn't want to live in the UK.

Moreover, she wants to have kids. She is not that young anymore and, with us living in different countries, that is simply not realistic. I don't know if I want to have kids, but I certainly don't want to have a kid in these circumstances. She told me that maybe she will change her mind about living in the UK - but how can I trust her on this? I believe she is being honest when she says this, but - as before - I think she isn't taking everything into consideration. I think that, as soon as she starts to take that possibility seriously, she will back down again. 

So what's the point of being in this relationship for both of us? There isn't one. We aren't going to live in the same country ever again. That being said, I still care for her - I know that this is going to hurt her. It was her idea to be in a long-distance relationship in the first place. So, how do I do this? All my breakups so far happened at a point where the relationship no longer made sense. How do you break up with a person that you still love and care for without hurting her? Maybe these questions are stupid and you cannot really help me, but I really need someone to listen and I don't really have friends that I can count on apart of my girlfriend. 

TL;DR: How do I break up with someone that you still love when you are in a long-distance relationship?",0
474,"Boys will be boys… I’m not so sure. I have 2 boys, 8 and 4. They are extremely playful and rambunctious. They wrestle (my 8 year old actually does wrestling as a sport) and it can get out of control. My boys have been doing something new though- they seem to think anything to do with their butt or penis is hilarious. Here’s some examples.

-While wrestling, my 4 year old will bite his brothers butt and they both laugh which leads to more butt humor/touching/motions whatever. 

-My older son is constantly farting intentionally in his brothers face. 

-Both boys are in some sort of challenge to tattle on the other for “touching my penis again” which is usually done when they are rough housing. 

My husband isn’t super modest himself and chalks it up to boys will be boys.. but I am not so sure. I have had many talks about respecting others genitals and bodies which they seem to understand but this is more of a humorous perspective they seem to have on it.

187,"My son lasted only 14 days in Kindergarten Hello everyone, I was hoping someone with a similar experience can give me information on what to do. I have a smart 5-year-old boy that we recently took out of school due to behavior issues. He was a fast learner growing up and he already knew a lot by age 1 (counting, colors, months, days, read small letter words) and was reading by age 2. He did certain things that worried me in the beginning, but my husband told me that was I overthinking it since he was our first child and he was going to be a bit different since he was so advanced. He was hitting all of his milestones perfectly (or faster than usual) and he had good eye contact, smiled at us, and responded to his name. As a baby, the only thing that stood out was that he would cry to certain videos or songs and would sometimes (not often) wake up crying hysterically at night as if he had a nightmare. He would also flap his hands when he was really excited/happy and he still does this. His behavior now: incredibly impulsive, very talkative, touches everything (or takes things out of peoples hands), has poor eye contact, obsessiveness (talks about certain things he likes all the time), loves to spin (only when playing), doesn't respond to us a lot of the time (he can hear us perfectly fine, it's just that he doesn't want to respond/ignores us), randomly hates certain sounds, songs or scenes and runs away/hides. He hates loud noises too, but only noises that he finds a problem. He has made videos/noises loud on his own. Some other issues we have with him: he hates it when people leave the house (has a lot of anxiety) and has chased people down which can be dangerous. He doesn't listen well at all and it is very frustrating. He's also very lazy/dependent. He refuses to feed himself a lot of the time and wants to be fed. He asks us for help putting on clothes and he also completely takes off his underwear/shorts to pee in the bathroom. He only uses one bathroom and must use his potty chair to do #2.

I knew he would have issues at school and it was a problem since day 1. He would not sit still, won't do his worksheets, would get into everything, and runs out of the classroom (thankfully the campus is gated), and he doesn't listen to staff. These past couple of days, he has started to hit, throw things and push students. I have already signed the forms to get him assessed at school (we had a meeting with his teacher, principal, and specialists); we will be bringing him in now that he's out. His pediatrician wanted him to try Adderall, but our insurance refused to cover it at his age. He will be screened for autism in the next couple of weeks with Alta and I have an appointment with a child psychiatrist in December. This was the soonest I could get him in. 

Should I just focus on homeschooling for now or possibly private schools? I don't think they would be able to deal with him either and they are usually a lot longer. He couldn't even last 3 hours. Any other things I should look into? Should I have his intelligence tested? I am located in Northern California if that helps. I have been feeling really sad that he isn't able to be in school. I have been looking forward to this day for so long. I am, however, also relieved he is out because they would call me almost every day and it was starting to give me a lot of stress. 

Thank you for any input, I know this is a lot of information.",1
1588,"Should I date him? Some background. I am 25F and currently in my 2nd year of graduate school. I was in a long term relationship for 3 years with someone that passed away in January 2021. After this my mom moved back in with me. 

In March 2021 I downloaded Tinder just for curiosity and fun. Definitely was not ready to date again. I ended up matching with a guy that made me laugh and was interesting. So we met up for food, and hit it off. But I told him I just wanted friends. He respected that and quickly became a close friend since we have the same hobbies and lifestyles. It's important to note after 4 months on Tinder he's the only person that caught my attention. 

In May 2021 we became FWBs. Since then we've gotten very close, closer than FWBs. He's helped me through so much healing. He makes me happy. We traveled together. I experienced new things. His family has welcomed me in with open arms. And I truly feel like I have someone in my court. Point being, I like him, so I want to date him. 

I brought this up to my mom and she was very against it. She told me I'm confused, that he wasn't right for me, that I shouldn't rush, that dating him would rob me of the opportunity to meet someone else. She brought up that she's always told me not to date my exes and look she was right they always ended. It was a very negative conversation, ending with her saying she gives up on me and is going to just let me crash into the wall since she can't change my mind. 

I feel confused. I firmly feel like I want to date this man. He makes me happy. He's a good guy. There is no reason to not date him. If it ends badly, oh well, nothing is lost and its just life. I couldn't predict the death of my ex either that doesn't mean I regret the time. But she's my mom and I want her approval and maybe she has a point? I'm not sure what to do. 

I also wonder if she's so against him because she doesn't like people of his race. A philosophy I obviously don't agree with.",0

2378,"Stuck in Love Triangle I'm currently off a three year relationship with my boyfriend. I wouldn't say that we've 'broken up' but rather that we are 'on a break'. We've had some disagreements and decided to take time away from eachother. 

A week after our split, I bumped into Grayson. Gray and I were friends throughout junior to highschool, but we cut off soon after meeting my boyfriend (few months before finishing school). Turns out that the company I was working part-time for, was his uncle's. He invited me out for a casual dinner right after my shift and I accepted. This became a habit and so right after work, he would wait for me in his car and give me a ride out. 

Eight days later, my boyfriend messaged saying that he wants to meet up. We agreed and scheduled for the following night. I decided that I had to let Gray know that we wouldn't eat out tomorrow night. I went in his car as per usual and he greeted me with a little velvet jewelry holder. I asked him what it was and he said that it was a necklace he wanted to gift me. He then pulled in to kissed me and tugged me to the back seat. When I realized what I was doing, I felt guilt instantly. I apologized, handed his gift back and left. I called my boyfriend and canceled for tomorrow, too.

I'm 19M and in therapy. I finally got a virtual session after a couple weeks of no shows because my therapist got quite sick. I was really itching to let them know about something I will forever be ashamed of.

A bit of backstory: I'm your stereotypical autistic furry. I once used to like something called cub porn, and I absolutely hate myself for it. My anxiety was sky high due to medication fuckery and one day I vented in a server I liked how I was afraid of liking it again and they kicked me. I'm also extremely ashamed of the way I reacted afterwards, harassing the admins trying to explain my side of the story and overall just making everyone there hate me. I dipped from the radar and deleted all of my accounts because there's no excuse for what I did and I am forever ashamed of it. All I will say is this: I NEVER want to be into that kind of shit again, I'd rather step on a bed of Legos than do so.

Earlier today I absolutely let it all out to my therapist, how much grief and remorse this has caused me, how people think of me as something I never want to be, how I often cry about this because it's so goddamn upsetting, how stuff like this is used to commit crimes and how there's people who make really good arguments justifying the stuff, and how I just feel like an overall horrible person. I couldn't fight back the tears, but my therapist took it all in and reassured me that everything would be okay, that the very fact that I am getting therapy for this is very big of myself, and that when he gets better we'll be able to go more in depth, and I thanked him so much.

When I came out to put the dishes away my dad said my voice was pretty loud and he was concerned about what I had said, that he never knew I was hurting this much and is proud that I sought out therapy for this but is a little scared now.

That's when I got MAD. I threw a tupperware container on the ground (fortunately it was a takeout bin) and I SCREAMED at them for listening to what I said instead of moving to another room. My mom tried to say that they felt a personal obligation to listen but I just said NO at the top of my lungs, that this is EXACTLY why I can never trust them again, I called them both the C word and went to my room absolutely mortified.

I got home from work today and my dad came into my room with tears in his eyes, saying he was extremely sorry for listening in on my session and that he shouldn't have done that, I just said that he should have thought about that before he did it and that I don't think I can ever forgive him, now I'm gonna need a lot more time to heal.

2356,"Don't know if I (25m) should ask more questions to my (24f) gf Some time ago my girlfriend had something bad happen in her life. She says it's a medical condition and she doesn't want to talk about it, she didn't even tell her parents about it, her ex boyfriend knows, but to be honest, I don't care much for it, sometimes it bothers me that she told him, but not me, but I digress.

It's not like she's keeping it a secret from me that something is wrong, she just doesn't want to tell me what. Like today she called me crying and said that something reminded her of that situation.

I don't know if she wants me to take the initiative and force(from a lack of better word) her to tell me or should I simply leave it as it is.

Everytime we talk about this, she says if the time is right she will tell me, and I just repsect it, but something tells me that I shouldn't just give up like that, and she might want me to fight to find that out.

I know that me knowing won't change much, but I also know that if she would want to keep it a secret, then I would know nothing about it. Then agian, there are stuff we people don't want to talk about, but it's nice to know someone cares and wants to know.

I just want her to be happy, and I want to help her with that, not sure how, but I suppose talking about it might help her, I don't know. 

It's hard for me too, not knowing what's up, but knowing there is something twrribke for her.

A couple weeks ago, we got in a fight over the vaccine. It was our largest fight, and although it didn’t get nasty it easily could have. Things have been pretty awkward since then, he has been struggling with his depression more than ever and I am struggling with trying to help him.

577,"Need help with my husband's  style So background: my husband and I don't just come from very different families. We come from different cultures, countries, and have different first languages. It really hasn't been an issue for years because we share personal values and are a team. We respect and love each other, and we talk out our issues. 

We both come from kind of disfunctional families, but mine is much more obviously disfunctional. We both want to do better. 

My own parents were abusive in some ways, so I have put in a ton of work into learning about effective, respectful . I have also worked hard on my own anger issues. I'm not perfect, but my daughter and I are very close. 

We have a nearly 5 year old daughter who struggles a bit with independence. Safe is capable of doing anything she needs to fit herself, but she wants to be cared for and have things done for her. She also has a lot of terrible focusing long enough to complete simple tasks. I strongly suspect she has ADD from me, but she is so young that we haven't been able to have her evaluated yet. 

The issues come up with the relationship between my husband and daughter. She just can't stand to let him help her with anything or listen to anything he asks her. And I can personally understand why. He uses shame and commands as his only tools. He is really heavy on the shame. I can see exactly where it comes from (his mom) and I watch his family do the same to him, me, our daughter, and his nephews. It's honestly awful and I have had to beg him to set boundaries with them before. They can be really mean. He isn't mean, but he does shame and compare our daughter to her cousins. Things like ""Even your baby cousin dresses herself. Why can't you?"" 

He doesn't seem to recognize how toxic it is or that he's doing it to our own child. It's so bad, that she regularly tells me she doesn't like her dad. It's not just a phase because she has been saying it for two years now. It breaks my heart because he is otherwise a very loving and attentive father. He is the dad I wished I had. 

I have talked to him about it many times. I have explained that it's not effective, that it puts an unfair  burden on me when our daughter refuses him only wants me for everything, that it's cruel, etc. He agrees at the time but then changes nothing. I have bought him three  books that he hasn't cracked open. I have sent him countless articles and videos. Nothing changes. He doesn't seem to really think that he is doing anything wrong. He seems to just think that something is wrong with our child, not him. 

I don't know what to do. Honestly. I'm exhaust and I feel like he is exacerbating the  issues by making them a battle of wills instead of trying anything that requires a bit more effort from him.

We've had the discussion of why it makes more sense for him to move as his job is more mobile. In addition the job stability and pay reduction for my profession isn't ideal for me to move. 

We had talks that eventually we need to find a way to close the distance but nothing was really set in stone the first two years as we were trying to get to know each other. At this time he was working for a a company to which he had mentioned to me he would request for a transfer to get closer to where I was living. He decided that he didn't like the job and transitioned to company #2 (still long distance). I was understanding and wanted to support his decisions so that he can do the things he wants to do without regrets. Another year passes and he moved to company #3 --- in his state, so we are still long distance --- and again I wanted to support him and didn't want to feel like I was imposing on his dreams. During this time (3-4 years into the relationship), I dropped hints at I do want to get married before 30 as that's just something I have always desired. To be able to settle down, have a family, and do things as a unit instead of apart. I have also mentioned to him that I do not know how much longer I can do long distance for. It's both physically, emotionally, and mentally draining and I am at a phase in my life where I want something more stable. I understand that he has things he wants to achieve, but I would like to see at least some progression in our relationship.

Now at 5 years being in a relationship, he switches jobs again. During the process of hunting for company #4 he tells me that ""he can't fail me again"" so he's going to try to find a job that is work from home. In that process, he finds a job but it still requires us to be long distance.  I feel like there is no end in sight and there is a lack of respect for me as a partner and any goals for us as a couple. At this point I felt like I've given him enough hints and I feel very frustrated. I told him that if he wants me to continue to give my time and do long distance, I would need him to show some commitment and this was when I suggested a timeline on an engagement. To which he said ""marriage never occurred to him during years of dating and that we should have talked about it more"" and that ""it is a bit too quick for him, but he will figure something out"".

I love and care about him so much and that is why instead of walking away, I wanted to give him a chance thus the ultimatum- did I go to far and ruin it by suggesting an ultimatum? 

I'm feeling very conflicted because on one hand I want to respect myself and walk away if we are not on the same page, and on another hand I feel like I may just have forced something that is suppose to be a natural process. Was it wrong for me to set this boundary/ultimatum for myself?",0

A few months ago I cheated on my partner once, right after it happened I told him what I did and he offered to try again. Then we broke up and spent some time apart now he wants to try again.

Have any men or women been in my husbands position? Did you resent it?did it cause issues with the spouse who wanted another?

My husband promises it won't cause any issues.
His reasons are the same ones his family put in his head.. baring in mind... he has two siblings 🤣🤣

1038,"I told my dad and his wife they are bad grandparents, was I out of line? Daughter is almost 8. Son is 5. My dad and his wife come to bday parties and Christmas. They invite us over about once a month for a usually 2 hour visit but completely ignore the kids. If the kids ask to come over other times than the once a month the answer is no. During the once a month visit they usually invite others over(other family and sometimes their friends) and spend that time talking to them, and me and the kids are usually left in the living room ignored. Last week they text me to bring the kids by for cupcakes. I assumed with school going back they wanted to see them. We pull up, are handed cupcakes and told they are leaving they had other plans.  I kinda snapped later on the phone I told them they are uninterested grandparents that they nothing about their grandchildren other than their age. It turned into a heated argument between me and dads wife. We are currently not on speaking terms. I feel like maybe I should keep my mouth shut and just be glad they invite us over once a month even if they make no effort to speak to the kids. My kids don't even know what to call my dad and frequently call him by their other grandfathers name. I am hurt by the disinterest in my kids. I am hurt my father allowed his wife to speak to me the way she did.. what is normal for grandparent relationships?

1257,"Looking for some insight from children of divorce about a potential move after divorce Hello, I am the dad of an 8 year old girl (soon to be 9). I love her to death, but her mom and I got together when we were much too young and immature, did not realize how completely wrong we were for each other, things got very toxic and did not work out after being together for 10 years. I initiated divorce mid-2020 after being separated for 6 months, and the divorce was finalized June of this year. During these 10 years, we both decided that we would live in the small town that we both met in, in order to stay midway between our families. Her family is three hours north (in yet another small town, even more in the middle of nowhere), and mine are two hours south (in a major US city).

During the divorce, I opted to go for full custody. Her mom, despite loving our daughter, is not the best parent. She has what I suspect is undiagnosed bipolar disorder, the shortest fuse to an explosive temper, and is a hoarder. Despite submitting a year's worth of text messages displaying angry outbursts, a laundry list of depression and anxiety medication, and pictures displaying the inside of our hoarded home, I lost custody due to her being a stay-at-home parent for the previous 7 years (which she did out of laziness, not a desire to raise our daughter a certain way), and some shenanigans that her and her lawyer played with the school schedule. I'm not a perfect parent either, but I 100% see our daughter having a better future with me than with her mother. I'm a salaried engineer with career ambitions, education, and drive, and her mother has never held a job for more than two years, along with zero drive to pursue anything other than minimum wage jobs. She is currently on welfare to help supplement her income, despite receiving $1,100/mo in child support from me in a low cost of living area. Their apartment is completely packed to the brim with boxes, my daughter barely has a bedroom.

So despite my daughter living one minute away, I only get to see her every 1st, 3rd, and 5th weekend now. On top of this, my ex requested approval to expand our geographic restriction to a radius that would make it to where she could move back to her family three hours north, which was granted because neither one of us have a support network here. So far, she has not taken use of that, and we have been tenuously co-, but our previous toxicities and her temper can make it very difficult at times. We get into an argument about every two weeks, and it's very draining. On top of this, I have basically zero chance of moving any further in my career here due to very limited opportunities, and the child support and increased taxes as a single filer with no dependents do financially strap me. I'm able to save a bit for retirement (6% of income), add to an emergency fund, and afford a moderate house ($1400/mo).

I'm thinking about moving two hours south where my family is at. Not even really for my family, although it would be nice to be there with them, but to be somewhere where I might have actual career opportunities. One fear is that if I don't offer my daughter an alternative place to live other than our current small town, she may become one of those people that never escapes the small town, and will have limited opportunities that come with that area. I also feel that having career options in a large city would lend itself to making more money, and thus being able to do better for her later in life. Save for her college, leave a larger inheritance, have a larger house with more amenities when she comes to visit, etc.

My parents said I could live with them for awhile to save up more for a down payment. My current equity in my house is \~$120k. I've been seriously dating another professional for over a year now (who has agreed to move wherever I need to so that I can do for my daughter, she has no kids) that has \~$100k to $150k equity in her house. So it wouldn't be out of the question for us to purchase a \~$400k house in a very LCOL area.

So I'm torn. I see three options:

1. Stay in the small town until she's 18 (10 more years). Risk her establishing herself here with minimal career prospects and growing up with the small town bible belt mentality. Also postpone any career prospects by 10 years.
2. Move to the large city when she's 12 or so and stops coming around on the weekends because she wants to be with friends instead of hanging out with me. Give her a great place to stay (big house, pool, own room+game room, etc.) when she is here with me, in hopes that maybe she'll want to come live with me when she's given the choice at that age (as opposed to her mother's hoarded apartment). Otherwise, visit on 1st, 3rd, and 5th weekends.
3. Move now, same thing as number 2.

I would love to be able to take her with me. In an ideal world, her mother would see the benefit of being in a wealthy area of a growing city with plenty of opportunity and we could all enjoy that. However, her mother is a small town girl and would never go for it. Most likely if I moved, she would move the three hours north to be with her family instead. Which would put me five hours from my daughter. The thought of that makes me sick, but I've spent $15k in lawyer's fees across several court appearances at this point just to end up where I'm at. At this point, I have zero faith in the justice system to do anything else.

I'm wondering, when my daughter is 30, what will she think of the choices I've made? Will she appreciate that I tried to give her and myself more opportunities and a more comfortable life? Or will she resent me for moving away from her?

Any insight from kids/parents that have been in this situation is appreciated. Thank you.",1

How do I approach this? Long story short, it was always my dream to come to America and study. And I did it! My parents were soooo supportive until the last few months when my mom became distant when I’d talk about it. 

Fast forward until I leave and I find out it’s a bigger issue. When I Facetimed my dad he let me know that my mom has asked him to not provide so much support to me (I have a brother who studies back home in Japan and they fully pay tuition and housing!). It’s not so much about the money though that’s disappointing considering I see my brother on instagram living a somewhat lavish life on my parents money,because I have a loan coming so that problem should be resolved but it’s just the whole different in support. My mother is so distant and literally controlling how my father is allowed to support my dream. 

How can I approach this? I don’t need my mom to fully support me but I just don’t want there to be any conflict in the family! I just want her to at least be “okay” with my move. It is so awful being so far away knowing my mom is upset.

As an example, I have my little makeshift office blocked off unless I’m sitting at my desk. She will immediately find a way in and start playing with papers and books and such.

Here comes the question part: my wife and I will firmly tell her no and remove her from my office space. She will quickly make her way back over as soon as she is free unless we distract her with videos or something. She does react to us telling her no or calling her name.

This is just one example, but there are many situations where we will tell her no and redirect away from something only to have her immediately go back to try again. Does she not understand the concept of no, or is she understanding and just ignoring us? Is it normal for kids her age to not understand? What could we do at this stage to help her learn?",1
960,"Tips to survive a newborn who likes to be held all the time? Baby boy is 5 weeks old. As title suggests, he likes to be held all the time. He has recently developed his ""I'm lonely cry."" Basically, he will tolerate 10ish minutes of being in the momaroo while awake. If he's awake and not being held, he cries. I am not/will not be the parent that let's him cry incessantly, though I do let him cry some.

I know it's not ALL just wanting to be held... as all newborns do, he has some gas. 

This is having a huge impact on my ability to pump. (I am pumping exclusively due to a latch issue.) I swear he can be deeply asleep and hear the pump turn on. This also impacts eating. 

My husband gets frustrated when he has to help so I can pump. He's a guy who likes to keep busy. He helps out so much...  does all the dishes and cooking. His frustration is he wants to do things like mow the lawn, etc  and can't because he needs to hold the baby so I can pump. 

I usually pump 4-5 times a day. My goal is to pump every 3 hours. It's often 5 hours between pumping sessions. 

I find myself often reminding my husband that baby is one month old.

In the beginning of our relationship I noticed that he was commenting on half naked girls Instagram‘s, saying things like oh my😍🥵 and Dayuumm🥵, so I snooped…which is wrong but I’m glad I did bc he was just on social media telling other ladies they’re hot.. Either way you look at it I just was not OK with that, I called him out on it and he Said he would no longer do that if it bothered me. I have been burned several times in the past, sometimes I just can’t get past it and I’m just really bothered by the fact that he felt the need to do that… I guess that’s my own insecurities playing a part there. For the most part he subsided I think. Anyways so I was looking up something on his phone yesterday and some random girl I never heard from had sent him a message on Twitter, so I clicked on it and I saw him and her having a conversation about her chest tattoo.

I feel uncomfortable that he’s asking some random girl on Twitter for a picture of her chest. Seeing as he has zero tattoos I don’t understand what his interest in some random girls chest piece would be.

I don’t know maybe I can get some opinions. I haven’t said anything to him and I don’t know if I’m going to, but I can’t stop thinking about it and it’s just bothering me.

1184,"Nursery Accident - What would you do My wife and I are having a minor disagreement regarding how our child's nursery handled an accident.

Last week our child had his thumb squished in a door after another child slammed it. His thumb is not broken but is very bruised and the nail will most likely fall off. He's fine and is showing everyone his injury and telling them to look at it.

My view is that this is a normal childhood injury and while it could have been prevented with soft close doors it's the sort of injury he could easily have got at home or in other houses. That having soft close doors in a nursery while a nice to have isn't essential. The staff have been suitably sympathetic but in my mind quite rightly haven't been falling over themselves to assign any blame to themselves.

My wife is far less blasé about the whole issue and wants to know what will be done to prevent accidents like this in future etc. She's dissatisfied with the directors response that the building meets all required safety standards.

2281,"My husband has been acting strange and distant whenever we're intimate and it's confusing me. 

Hello, throwaway so he doesn't see this.

I F28 have been married to my husband M35 for 4yrs. *important note* he was married twice before me and both marriages ended due to infidelity on his exes part. We generally have a somewhat healthy marriage, we rarely fight. He's the type who remains calm, slow to react, doesn't start fights, doesn't raise Hus voice in any arguments we have but can be passive in other wise like heavily using silent treatment methods though he calls it ""taking time to cool off"" but I'm pretty sure it's not.

Right now we don't have any major issues in our marriage except for few small arguments here and there. However I noticed this one thing about him  lately... Whenever we are done having sex he'd pull away and becomes distance for the next 10 hours or so. Every time, every time after we are done having sex he'd try to male an excuse to leave the room or go be with himself. I felt confused as he was is usually the one to initiate, he's usually the one who wants us to be intimate whenever he's in the mood but even with that he'd still pull away right after sex like he was disgusted with me or something, I just couldn't help but feel this way. It affected my self esteem and confidence because he kept making me feel like there was something wrong with me. He won't even sleep in the bed with unless we don't have sex prior to going to bed .

I've sat down with him and we've talked after he tried to avoid having this conversation by saying stuff like ""that's not true"" our ""it's all in your head"" but I've pointed out how out of character for him to basically get away from me after sex and act like he's disgusted and upset. He admitted that I was  right and said he for some reason gets a weird feeling about me after sex and hates when I try to touch him or even be in the same room as him but that feeling goes away hours later. He said he ignored it hoping it'd go away permanently and on it's own but it's still there. I felt like he gave no proper explanation and that there was something he's not telling me. I tried talking about it again but I ended being shut down by him claiming I was pressuring him to act in certain way to please me like he was my doll. He started getting angry whenever I mention it which made it worse to figure out what the problem is.

I'm unsure of what to do at this point, I've consulted my friend who's been married before and said her cheating ex acted like my husband is acting now. Saying he's probably experiencing something new with someone new and is deliberately distancing himself. I got uncomfortable thinking about this possibility especially when others agreed my friend has a point.",0
2945,"Is my boyfriend making me intentionally jealous? There’s this thing that really worries me. Often when I’m (19 F) somewhere with my boyfriend (18 M) and our friends, he’s very vocal about other girls. What I mean is, I sit right next to him, he talks to someone and says things like “Oh yeah this girl you’re talking about! She was there just a few minutes ago, you always recognise her because she has such a good ass!” Or “I met her sister the other day. She’s such a hottie compared to her sister! Like literally, so hot.” When we were on vacation, I was saying something and while I was talking, a girl in white legging shorts walked by with her boyfriend and he was literally following her with his gaze the entire time I was talking and then turned back and said “sorry what? I was mesmerised by the girls butt”. 

Then he comes to me and wants to touch me and I’m so defensive and pouty because I suddenly feel so unattractive and small.

Honestly, I know what boys are like. You just look and think of others that they’re attractive whether you have a girlfriend or not. But this just really hurts me and affects me in ways I don’t like. I’m not at all that vocal about other boys and I can’t think of any of my friend’s boyfriends who’d to that.

We had intended to make it disappear at some point when she was younger, which is what we did with our older kid, but it was COVID times and we just decided to put it off. Honestly been dreading this for a while because she is pretty tantrum-prone to begin with, so we cut out the passy except for nap/sleep a while ago, and then made a plan to set a date, arrange a visit from the passy fairy, get her a blanket instead, all that. 

The first night was perfect. Then every night since she has started screaming and kicking uncontrollably for half an hour in the middle of the night and then goes back to bed. She also used to be a clockwork napper and has since not napped at home. 

I’m debating whether this is worth it. I really don’t want to go back because her fixation on the passy was a bit much already, but if she’s getting night terrors and won’t nap because she doesn’t have it I don’t know if that’s normal bumps or something more serious. It’s been I think 5 days since the transition.

I need some consolation and advice on how to not be so negative. I wanna tell my mom and dad but I feel like they'll resent her if I do and I don't want that. I want someone to knock some sense into her because she constantly says I'm really good to her and I have done nothing wrong but she just can't shake this feeling that maybe I'm not the one. It's 1 AM and I can't sleep and I need someone to tell me something good =(",0
957,"Advice for emotional maturity in Kindergarten Hello all. I am a first time poster so nice to meet you all. Today is week three of school starting and I thought things were going great! 

My (JUST turned 5) kindergartener has a colors sheet that shows if they had a good day (Green Day) or a bad day (red) or somewhere in between. He has had good days 2/3rds of the time! I thought nothing of this, he’s 5, kids have rough days sometimes. All is well…. Until this afternoon.

I received a call from teacher who had expressed concern over my child being easily frustrated (when trying to boot up computers or when he doesn’t understand the assignment). This is what apparently has resulted in “bad days”. She informed me these “episodes” or tantrums don’t last very long, but have happened a few times since school started.

I get it! Last year was hardly preschool, and he’s adjusting.

Except she mentioned she thought it would be best to “hold him back” a year so that he can emotionally mature.


Idk if it’s just me but I felt that him being home so off and on from preschool did not do him any favors. I want to help teach him regulating emotions (ie not getting frustrated but instead asking for help) and I just am feeling very discouraged as a parent. I feel like I have failed my child somehow. This is my first and only child so any input or advice is appreciated.",1
2993,"My husband (49) betrayed me (49) and now leaves our family First: english is not my mother language so excuse my bad english, this is my first post on Reddit.

I dont know where to start. Last week my husband told me that he had sex with another woman (a coworker) several times and wants a divorce. I feel so bad and dont know what to feel anymore. We were together for more than 30 years. He will move out next week and leave me and my two children (12, 19). We have a huge house and garden and idk how to handle all this stuff at the moment. We will have Financial issues and my children do not talk to us anymore. I‘m totally down. 
The biggest problem is he doesnt care about us. He leaves us and is not interested in our future. 
He was my true love for all this time and I feel like I‘m losing my purpose in life. We have no friends because we only focused on each other for all those years. 
There is no one I can talk to and I hoped some strangers could help me.

TLDR: my husband betrayed me and now leaves our family after 30 years with no regrets.",0
2472,"Job hopping partner My (26f) partner (43m) and I have been together 6yrs. We met working at a restaurant (S) when I was back home from uni doing a summer job. He is from a different country than I and emigrated here not long before we got together. We have lived together for about 2yrs and moved to a brand new town as he was already working close by and I got a job here after graduating.

Whilst I finished uni and got a good, stable, government job, he has hopped from one hospitality job to another- the longest stint being 9 months and that was at S.

To be fair, his idea was to work his way up to management until one day he became a hotel GM and I appreciate hospitality, especially in this country, had a high turnover and that was the culture. And so I backed him and believed in him.

He did find a restaurant manager job 1.5 yrs ago which he seemed to really like as was able to flex his creative muscles a bit but was let go during the pandemic  as the owner decided to sell up.

Before COVID he has had about 20 different jobs in the time I've known him. 

Since the good manager job above, he has had jobs as hotel GM- dream achieved but the role turned out to be nothing but a  glorified waiter (which seems to be the case in a lot of these places) and he quit after a week because they literally ran him into the ground, so I did understand that.

He then got a computer related trainee job but was unfairly dismissed. This has happened in hospitality too and has been treated awfully by colleagues and the higher-ups. It really is a horrible industry. But most of the time, his reason for leaving tends to be that someone has pissed him off so much, he then cant deal with it.

He has now got another manager job which is about 39hrs max, friday-saturday off. We've had some nice weekends together recently which has meant the world  to me because usually he'd be working whilst I'd be off.

He now wants to leave this one because another manager is rude to him and he says it gives him anxiety and depression. The employers haven't yet given him a contract though and he's been there for 2months, which is unsettling and I understand that my SO feels insecure due to that. However, he did talk to his boss about this and they reassured a contract would be on its way...at some point...

Now I don't know if I'm TA or not but this constant change stresses me out. I have spent a lot of time helping him with applications, including the lengthy teacher training one which he then decided not pursue at the last minute because he had to pay for equivalency exams.

I would really like to buy a house soon, with him, and start planning our future but he says we can't until he's found a stable job. 

His recent idea was to save up and become an entrepreneur since he is obviously not capable working for the man. He is currently studying a masters degree part time distance learning to help get out of hospitality which he due to complete early next year but with all the interviews and applications recently, that's been put on the back burner. He's not lazy and doesn't quit jobs before having another lined up. BUT I'm starting get impatient, I've lost my energy for supporting him now when it sounds like he can't control his frustrations. My job is also hectic and full of annoying people but since I'm the stable one, I just have to put up with it.

&amp;#x200B;

He's not totally at fault but since this has happened so so much, its obviously an issue with him rather than the job and I just don't know why he is entertaining the idea of another bloody hospitality job when he knows full well what it will be like. If he applies for something completely different then I'd support him all the way. And in fact he had been doing that before he got this job but since he has so much experience in hospitality, they're the only jobs coming through.

I'm worried so much change will affect job prospects in the future, mortgage eligibility etc. I've tried talking to him but he just argues with me, loudly and is sometimes insulting. I don't want to hold him to a job he hates but the idea originally was to do this until he can finish his degree, save up a bit etc and then go from there. I also don't want to ruin my life by waiting and waiting for him. I'm perhaps an idiot, I don't know.

Please advise, thank you.",0
729,"Projecting My Wants Onto My Kid I have an 18-year-old daughter and I often feel as if I'm projecting my wants onto her. When I think about it, she doesn't really talk to me about what SHE wants. And when she does, I feel as if I question it. In the back of my mind, I think ""why would you want or do that?"" For example, she once told me that she wanted to take the train downtown where we live, and I questioned it. I was like ""I can drive you anywhere you want. Why would you want to take the train?"" And not once did I consider, maybe that's just something SHE wants to do. And I feel as if I'm forcing her to distance herself from me. Does one else have a similar experience?",1
2446,"Girl [22F] I'm [26M] dating lost feelings fast during long-distance, where did we go wrong?  

Sorry for a long post but I'm very confused and wanted to give all the details

So I \[26M\] met a girl \[22F\] through Tinder in the middle of february, we're both going to the same university and live 1 minute from eachother. Initially we only had 1 date which went great as we hit it off and talked and laughed for hours and had sex etc, but apparently I gave off relationship vibes and 2 weeks later with barely any contact she told me she wasn't ready for anything serious and we cut off contact. It didn't bother me and I wrote it off as a one-night stand, no biggie.

I ran into her in the beginning of april and we talked and a few weeks later I contacted her and we set a date at my place the last week of april. Everything went great, just like the first date but this time I made sure not to give any relationship vibes after the sex and we just kept talking. We saw eachother once a week for the next 3 weeks and contact in between dates was only for setting dates and her sending selfies when she wanted to talk etc. At this point we started seeing eachother more and I started spending nights at her place after dates and after we ran into eachother at parties etc, sometimes we just talked, cuddled, ate sandwiches etc. I was also introduced to her friends and classmates and she had no issues showing me affection infront of them, and they all seemed to like me. At this point there were clearly feelings involved as more personal things were discussed and she told her parents about me.

The problem here was we had only been seeing eachother for 5 weeks and in another week I was going back to my hometown for summer. We saw eachother 3 times that week, once we went out to eat dinner and back to her place and the night before I left we were at her place. After sex I asked her how she wanted to deal with us during summer, I know to let her bring that up usually but I figured since I was leaving the next day someone had to say it since it's not like I could just wait for her to bring it up when we see eachother next week, or the next week like usual. We mutually, for real, decided it's not serious but it's too good to give up and we'll keep contact and see eachother when we can and get back together in autumn, I also said I wouldn't date anyone else but I'm not ready to close the door on something else happening. The first week we talked a few times, say every other day and we both initiated and things were flirty and fun. She booked a trip to visit friends in another town and was stopping in my hometown for a day to visit cousins, so obviously I got excited to see her and told her we should see eachother. Since she was only here for a day she only had time for coffee and I was fine with that. Her cousins gave her a ride to the place and when we met we hugged and I kissed her which the cousins saw and things went great and she asked when I was coming to her town and later that night she contacted me to thank for the coffee and was all hearts.

A few days later without contact was my birthday and she messaged me happy birthday at like 1AM when we were both drunk so I responded in the morning and we talked a bit, but she seemed more distant than usual though I didn't let it bother me. A couple days later I messaged her that I was coming to her town in 2 weeks and was gonna be there for 2 weeks as I have lots of friends there too. She didn't seem too excited but we decided we were gonna see eachother that weekend. The next 2 weeks she was kinda distant and didn't initiate contact but we only spoke about 2 times a week. When we met at her place we laughed and had sex as usual but she was kinda distant and didn't want me staying the night as she had to get up early (never an issue before). A few days later I tried to set a date and she was giving me the 'maybe', and next day she said she couldn't so I asked her what's going on to which she said things felt like they were getting too serious and she was gonna do the good ol' slow fade, which I called her out on and she explained it as ""it's what I usually do after a few dates when things go too fast"", which should have been a red flad as we were a bit further in than a few dates. We met the next day in a park to talk about it and she pointed to me being so excited to see her in my hometown, kissing infront of the cousins and me saying we're dating, her thinking I have us a label, as big things. I'll give her the kiss infront of the cousins but the others I explained aren't big deals and ofcourse I'm excited to see her, and since we're seeing eachother and having sex, yeah we're dating. She also explained how she had been in a 4 year relationship a year ago and wasn't willing to go into something like that again, to which I responded I'm not that far ahead, I'm just having fun with someone I like and whatever happens happens. After the serious talk we talked for hours and went home, kissed and said goodbye. We saw eachother again a week later at her place and things went great, just like before I left town.

2 days later I contacted her late afternoon and she didn't respond all night but I saw she was active on Instagram around midnight as I was sending memes with a friend. This was the first time she had ever done so and ofcourse my mind went to her seeing someone else but I didn't react to it. She responded the next morning and while she wasn't distant there were no selfies etc, but we talked for a while. A few days later I tried to set another date on the night I was going home and she gave me the maybe, and the night before the date she sent me a text at 11PM saying how she had to study and couldn't see me and hoped I was okay with that. Ofcourse I wasn't and asked if we could take a walk the next day which we did and I told her I know something is wrong and this isn't working. She started crying and told me about suffering from anxiety and having panic attacks, she had told me this before, and not having time for her own life because she keeps agreeing to doing things with everyone all the time, so we broke it off saying we might see eachother when school starts in a month and kissed. She did admittedly have a lot of schoolwork from failed courses etc, but I knew this wasn't the real reason and her instagram posts confirmed that as she didn't seem too unhappy. A month later I contacted her and she said no and seems to think she did nothing wrong trying to slow fade me.

So basically I'm struggling to see where I was really going too fast with her as in my mind these are all tiny things that she's overreacting to after letting them fester in her head for weeks, and someone you've been intimate with for 2 months being affectionate with you shouldn't be too bad + I wasn't exactly bombarding her phone and up until my birthday we both contacted eachother equally, and I'm thinking she might just be a 'the grass is always greener'-person who would have lost feelings no matter what as I wasn't there or if her fears of me being too serious was always gonna mess it up no matter that, or if she just wanted to feel like she had a boyfriend for a bit. So where do you guys think I or she went wrong with this?",0
2214,"Juggling a LDR (?) and recent deaths in my family Hello friends! This is my first time posting in here. I was hoping to get some thoughts on a situation (not necessarily advice), as I have a lot going on at the moment and I need to get it out somewhere. Buckle up, it's going to be fun.

I (25f) started dating my bf (25) back in April and we made it official in May (started on a dating app). He and I live at least an hour and a half away from each other, which may not make it a LDR, but difficult to say the least. He and I are both working on master's degrees, and I'm hoping to graduate in December. He's in school full time, and I will be starting an internship soon. We typically see each other on weekends, and throughout the summer, I would make an extra trip during the week to see him. 

Just 2 months into dating, I lost my father to ALS. He was very supportive, and made the trip to see me for a few weekends in a row. Then, one of my dogs (who I've had since I was 11) died just a month later. To say the least, I've been feeling kinda lonely.

The issue is, I don't expect him to take time from his studying to see me. And with my upcoming schedule, I'll be busier too. We have tried video chatting once during the week when we were both in school back in the spring and it worked. However, I just crave his presence that a video chat can't really give me. Does anyone have thoughts on what they have done before, or just in general? I understand there's a lot to unpack.

Thanks!",0

On Saturday I was chilling with one of my guy friend named John.So Sam comes by again and tells john oh let’s go do something and I was like we both are about to head home.

1974,"Close friend (26/F) continuously going to bar (26/F) my ex works at Let me start off by saying I’m posting this for my sister. 

So my sister has a close friend, Rachel, and an ex, Mike. Mike works as a bartender in a bar in NYC. My sister was strung along by this guy mike for a couple months. They never officially dated but he would give off mixed signals, tell her he didn’t want a relationship, but then would talk about the future with her and do other stuff that was “relationship-esque”. My sister ended things with him almost a year ago. 

So a couple months ago Mike got a job at a bar that my sister and her friend Rachel went to often with other friends and it was kinda close to where they live in city. Ever since Mike got a job there my sister doesn’t ever want to go there because she doesn’t want to interact/see Mike. So when Rachel and her friends go out she chooses to stay home or do something else. My sister feels hurt by Rachel because Rachel knows how Mike treated my sister and Rachel knows my sister doesn’t want anything to do with him. 

Two weeks ago my sister talked to Rachel and told her how she felt hurt by Rachel continuously going to that bar and disregarding my sisters feelings. Rachel didn’t really say much and continues to go to the bar. 

I’m torn because my sister expressed her feelings to Rachel, but Rachel obviously doesn’t care and still goes to the bar Mike works at but at the same time Rachel shouldn’t have to stop having fun because of my sister. It’s also NYC and there’s a million bars so it’s not like there’s a lack of places to choose from. 

All inputs welcomed. 

TL;DR : sisters friend disregards her feelings after communicating. Sister feels hurt.",0

Or faced these fears and have an opinion? Thank you.,0
1,"Normal common sense in a child... My son just turned 7, and at times he seems like he's really smart (great reader, doing well in our piano lessons), but at other times he just seems soooo idiotic with practical things.

It's hard to give good examples of this. But I'm trying to get him to pay attention to times and clocks as well as calendars. He seems to be doing fine with that, but omg applying it and why he needs to learn to do it is another story.

For example, his tuck time on schoolnights is 8:30pm and I let him watch a little tv until 9:30pm where I turn it off whether he's still awake or not. He likes to get up around 6:30'ish, but in reality we don't need to be up until like 8:15am or so. So for practice, I ask what time he got up, and usually he can answer that ok, but once he can give me a good answer consistently I told him I'll give him more leeway and he can starr making his own decisions about bedtimes (to hopeful give him some incentive). He just needs to learn to do the simple math that he needs 8-9 hours of sleep so if he wants to stay up later, he needs to sleep in later.

Anyway, he wanted to lay down a little earlier (around 8pm), just so he can chill a little longer in bed with the tv at 9:30pm. I could have sworn I checked on him at 9:30pm, but I missed turning off the tv, or sometimes our tvs are stubborn and delays button clicks (so I could have accidentally turned it off or back on as I was walking out and didn't notice it went back on). Anyway, so I was doing my thing and I heard his tv still on at midnight and he was still awake watching it!

It's like comon kiddo, you know the tv needs to be off at 9:30pm, and he said well I didn't turn it off. And I keep telling him, adults aren't perfect kiddo, that was my mistake, but you should've known that it wasn't ok just to stay up and keep watching it just because I made that mistake. So now if you're too tired for school, you're still going to have to go and just suffer through it. That's why you have bedtimes and you need to sleep in until 8am and not just get up willy nilly without paying attention to the time especially for tomorrow morning. I'll have to keep an ear open and see if he uses the bathroom before 8am then to tell him to sleep more.

I know it sounds small and petty, but it's like this lack of common sense or just applying the knowledge to life that  can really drive a parent nuts when it happens often and at random. It's like understanding the ""reasons"" why we do something, even if I explain it to him, just never sinks in. 

It's particularly hard on me, because I have to deal with a narcissist mother (I have full custody since she did some awful things) I have to walk on eggshells with and he has a meeting with her after school tomorrow. So if she sees that he's tired, she's just going to stir up drama.",1

3180,"He cheated on me. I want to be with him. What how can I trust him again? Hello. I (30F) learned recently that my partner (36M) of 8 years was speaking with his ex (34F and married) and when he was on a trip to see his friends he cheated on me with her. This of course has torn me apart. We have two children together and I love him very deeply. In these 8 years we had our little relationship problems, which I thought we solved, and we also had our health battles together (he had cancer). I always thought I was supportive, but he isn't one to share much of his thoughts and feelings.
Two weeks ago, after he went for drinks with his friends, and after finding out that she went with them (she was on vacation here, she doesn't live here) I flipped and search his phone. I found some calls and confronted him and he said it was nothing. I didn't believe him since when we had started dating she was sending text and going to his work begging him to be together again, note that at the time she had just got married. I texted her and told her that if she called him again I would say everything I know to her husband. I wanted to believe him so for a while I acted like everything is fine.
But in me doudt was growing stronger, so once again I checked his phone and I found a conversation in Viber (he had password on the conversation her birthday). They were talking for the last 5 months and also found out they slept together once, when he was on a trip to see him friends.
When I confronted him he said it was his mistake, it's all his fault, I did nothing wrong, and he wants to be with me because he loves me. 
My first thought was that I want to be separated and I still think that we end up like this. But I love him too much and I really want to give him a chance.
Now note, that right now he is a stay-at-home dad, since he stopped working and he wants as soon as our children start the new year of school to find a new job. So he doesn't have an income of his own and if we break up he has nowhere to go. I told him that if it is for us to break up I would wait first for him to find a job and be able to live of his own. A part of me is worried that he wants to be with me because he has nowhere to go. Though he is a very pride person, and makes his own money all his adulthood and I know that being ""fed"" from me isn't want he wants for his life.
I also asked him to go into counseling to save our family, but he says he doesn't want that and I should go if I want and if he is needed he will come. He said he wants to fight for us with his everyday behavior and acts. 
How can I overcome his cheating? Am I paranoid for checking his phone? Please tell me what is the best thing to do.",0
1484,"Disagreements on raising kids. Alright, here I am again with a husband issue.

We are very fortunate to make decent money, my husband more so and we certainly fall into the the ""have"" category vs ""have not"" My husband insists on telling out son we are poor - which simply is not true (if we were going by my income alone then yes). We are never struggling to pay bills and more.

My husband believes this will help our kids appreciate things more. I disagree and feel that our son telling friends and others we are poor could be insulting and have maybe the opposite effect. I believe our son should understand how fortunate we are to have what we do, while also respecting everyone else.

Honestly I don't know why he has to insist on telling our three year old these things at all as he doesn't understand...but it's yet another area where we disagree.

It’s not like she doesn’t make any sounds at all but there is no ba-ba or da-da or pa-pa. It’s mostly humms or arghhs (when annoyed). We are getting more and more anxious now that she is already 7.5 months that she hasn’t said a single consonant. Are we overreacting? Is it still too soon? I understand every baby is different and that’s what is there online mostly but it isn’t helping us. 

We have tried to engage her in a lot of activities but she just doesn’t want to communicate back. She gets engaged but doesn’t engage back if that makes sense. We are sure that her hearing is good. When and what should we worry about? 
Thanks",1

3132,"My partner seems to make me insignificant in her conversations Me and my partner have been together for about two years which is in my opinion is a fairly long time. just earlier she was having a conversation with a colleague of hers. Before I explain I would just like to put out there that I have been dropping my partner off to work every day for almost 2 years. The days I was unable to drop her was either when I was sick or had other reasons like sleeping in due to being tired, other than that I would be dropping her off to work and picking her up. Now she was having a conversation with someone she would be potentially working alongside and they were discussing pros and cons about the job she was thinking to apply for, he asked her how she gets to work now and instead of saying that her partner drops her off and some days she makes her way she completely said that she makes her own way to work every day and in the end that I drop her off sometimes. To me that sounded quite shady. I don’t understand what was so hard about telling the truth. I understand not wanting to bring your relationship up but the conversation had to do with me in a way. I don’t know what was hard about saying my partner drops me off most days but I make my own way other days. I’m not insecure and this isn’t a big deal to me just made me think what her other conversations are like. This was all happening while I was sitting right next to her and she said that without hesitating. I was a bit moody and she pushed me into telling her what was happening wrong and I opened up and told her how I felt and she said I was making a big deal and that she has brought me up to her current co-workers, now that I understand but this is a potential guy she could be working with who she has been working alongside but not exactly because they are from two different companies who help each other out. She then proceeds to tell me that what she said was the truth and that those days where she made her way to work somehow turned me dropping her off to work everyday into 80% which I believe is 90% but anyway she thinks she was being honest. That still hurts and is the reason why I tend not to open up about things to her because she understands what she wants to understand and it’s why I bottle everything up and bite my tongue. 

I don’t know if what or how I’m feeling is wrong, I just need to know what and how I can repair this. Or how I should go about this.",0
3031,"Apologies Alright, my boyfriend of 10 months picked a fight in front of my friend whom he had met once before. Without getting into too much detail, he got drunk and picked a fight during our lunch and became belligerent and downright disrespectful making my friend and I  uncomfortable and the situation extremely awkward . Ultimately it got to a point where he wouldn’t leave and situation wasn’t getting better. I had to escape to restaurant bathroom and my friend had to demand several times that he leave.

We have our issues but after that very public  display in front of my good friend  I felt exceptionally humiliated and disrespected. 

He has since been very apologetic for losing control. Problem is I feel it is a non negotiable that he should apologize to my friend for putting her in that position. 

He says he doesn’t feel comfortable doing so yet. I feel this  is a non negotiable and he should immediately apologize to my friend for putting her in that position. Any thoughts on this ?

2090,"Should I help my father economically? He asking for economical help but He doesn't care to have a relationship with me I (F 29) want to warn you guys that this could be too long and had some misspelling since English is not my first language and thanks for taking the time. 

I was born in Nicaragua at the end of 90's. I have some memories of my childhood but mostly I remember my Mom as a single mother. When I was around 6-7 years old I was on my livingroom, I don't exactly remember what I was doing but a man called me by my name and said that I had grownup a lot. I didn't recognize him, but it was my father who left my mother after him being disappointed that my younger sister was born with brown skin. My father and mom have light skin, but both have family that don't have light skin but dark like my mom's father.

I have two sisters One is older and her father is different than mine. And a younger sister who has the same father as mine. 

I don't exactly know how long he left for but I probably was too young. So after he show up again in my life, my mom tried her best to keep us in communication with my father eventhough they were separated. 

He lived outside the city like one hour away. After this I remember him showing up on our birthdays so we could go eat with him. No every Birthday but some. He had a different life than us and he really never show so much care to spend time with us. 

School in Nicaragua runs from Feb to Dicembre but there are Vacation on April and I think July or so where we get like two weeks off school. On those holidays my mom would work super hard and she would send us to my father's house. 

I'm no gonna lie, my best memories are from those times where we would go and spend time with him. He didn't mind that my older sist wasn't his, he saw her as his daughter didn't discriminate. I remember all of us biking to the river or going to buy food. I even remember him singing songs to me before going to bed. 

He live very closely to his family, but  they were always cold to us, bcs they didn't like my mom. My grandmother from my dad side would tell me sometimes that an earthquake was going to happen, I'm very afraid of earthquakes, and she knew it and she would tell me this just to torment me. I couldn't sleep at night sometimes. She would also prefer my cousin because he was a boy. I don't know if still the same but having milk in my country for breakfast is something fancy. So I remember her fixing warm milk with coffee for him so he could had his favorite breakfast. And to us just some coffee. 

One of my most sad memories from childhood is my dad coming to our house when mom wasn't there. I believe he was waiting for her to left the house so he could get inside the house. So we opened the door because he was our father. And he would go to my Mom's bedroom and he opened her closet to still her Money. In our faces. Then he left. We told our mom and after that we didn't see him much. 

I was younger so I didn't realize this and many other things until now. Is true that my father was good when we spend that time with him, but he never helped my mom with money neither he look to spend time with us if it wasn't for my mom. 

We emigrated to US on 2005 and I remember him no wanting to sign the papers. But in the end he signed them so My mom, my sisters and I were able to move here. He really didn't care much. Even after we move to the US he never bothered to call or write a letter to us. And he knew all this information.

We all went to school and university here in the United States. We all have job, none of us are married, honestly our family was so dysfunctional that I think is why none of us want to get married. We all live in the same house with my mom, we all help eachother so economically we are doing okay. 

Mom sometimes likes to go to Nicaragua and spend like a month there then she comes back. We like to travel and we have being in Japan, Taiwan, Mexico ect. We do own the house where we live. So everyone knows by mom that we are doing pretty well. 

So when my younger sister went to Nicaragua with my mom two years ago. She wanted to see our father, but she said she was very disappointed about how he and his family would constantly ask for money. So she is someone who speak what she feels and said some horrible things to them. And cut ties with them. 

I don't how but my Father get my mom's Wassup. And recently he asked my mom to pass a message to us where he said he sick and need money and that we could help him, bcs he our father. My older sister decided to help him bcs she is really grateful that he didn't discriminated her when we spend time together. My younger sister said a big No. 

Is true that helping my father would not economically affect me. But now that I'm old and I can see clearly how bad he really was... I don't really find any emotional or sympathy toward him. But I'm his daughter and I'm wandering if I should help him... I don't know what to do. 
 

Thanks for reading!


I forget to mention that he has other kids same close age as me and a boy who I think is now close to his 15yrs(?). He has a wife now too. His older sister had a stroke, and his mother fell and she can't move much. But my father has like 5 brothers him being the second after the older one.",1

My newborn is nearly 3 weeks old. The only schedule we have for him is for feedings. He was born at 35 weeks so these past weeks we’ve been focusing on getting him to gain weight and establishing breastfeeding. 

I feel it’s hard to get him on a schedule because he naturally sleeps a lot. It’s hard to catch him awake and keep him that way for a stretch of time. So no really set nap times

We planned a weekend together several months in advanced and a week before the trio she canceled due to covid cases have been too high. But she turned around and said I can drive to her (an 8 hour drive) for just a day. 

I got mad and we argued. I claimed theres no difference in the end. Me and you there is the same as me and you here. but in the end I said fine I'll visit. 

So a few days in advanced I got a little flirty and was trying to talk dirty in a way to kinda spark something for when I'm there. And all I got was ""we have so many places to go"" ""we'll have fun""

I say I can't wait to hold you and kiss you. And all i got was ""let's go to park and take a walk"" 

So I asked her does she not even want to have sex? Like yeah sue me, I can't demand that. But I haven't seen her in months you'd think we'd do some thing like that. 
She doesn't. At all and I'm in the wrong for asking. 

I'm mad that a weekend got changed to a day. And I'm sad I can't see her as long, and I'm confused why she's acting like this. 
(If you want to be friends just say it, don't lead me on, by acting like this.)

I am very certain she's acting weird for Her. But do I have any right to be mad?

2906,"Toxic relationship but, I want him Long story short. Our relationship was toxic. We were together for a year and 4 months? He (19M) messaged other girls flirtatiously when we first started dated for months. We broke up but we were still talking about getting back together and I (19F) kissed someone else. I have been dealing with mental health issues for multiple years now and I had trouble trusting him. I would put my issues on him. He would get angry at me but most of the time he was supportive. 

Three to four weeks ago, I was very mentally unstable and I tried to kill myself. I said things to him that would be classed as emotional abuse. I decided to break up with him in that moment. The next day, he messaged a girl I was very insecure about as she was one of the girls he was flirtatious with at the beginning of the relationship. I found this out by logging into his snapchat which wasn’t the right way to go about it. I confronted him about it and said we broke up and he could do what he wanted then decided to deny that choosing to message her had no intent of hurting me. Looking back at our conversations, I do believe he was gaslighting me. He then wanted to meet me, gave me a list of things he would do differently and to regain his trust if we decided to get back together. We were talking like normal but we would argue because I would bring up an issue or he would get angry. He ignored me for a week. I called him very upset and confused as to why he was ignoring me after insisting he was going to put in the effort. He said he wanted some space and he thought it would be best for me too. He didn’t tell me he ever wanted space and he convinced me he was going to put effort for us. He said he still loved me but, wasn’t ready to fight for me or talk to anyone. Then I found him on Bumble the next day. A few days later, I realised that I missed my period. I took a pregnancy test and it came back positive. I told him about it. He responded that he would help but I decided to not take his help since he said he wanted space. The phrasing wasn’t as kind as that since I was upset. He ignored me and hasn’t contacted me since. 

Also I got therapy to work on my mental health a couple days after the whole breakup, bad mental state situation happened.

When we were together, our relationship was amazing. The things I have described above were just the bad things that have happened in the relationship. When things were good, they were really good. I use to write him letters, make him care packages etc. and he would take me to do puppy yoga and drive through safari dates etc. But, I feel like he has changed now yet, I still love him with all of my heart and want him. We use to promise each other that we would be together forever and that no one else would take us away from each other. It is very clear that he doesn’t want me. I just don’t know what to do.",0
161,"Can't Get Toddler to Stop Having Accidents Despite Knowing How to Use the Potty I'll try to keep this brief, but we're pretty desperate for advice. 

Our daughter is 3, and last year she was potty trained. She seemed game for it, we did the Oh Crap! method, and by day 2 she nailed it. I think our hubris is our downfall here because we felt pretty smug the next couple weeks.

After that, she started having accidents. We've tried doing the method again (like a reset), we've tried stickers, we've tried other bribes (which I know we're not supposed to). Since then, she'll maybe go a week or two and it's all good, then go back to having one or two accidents a day (usually spurned by some kind of change/not perfect sleep, but sometimes it seems random). 

The thing is, she never has poop accidents because, according to her, poop is gross and belongs in the potty, but she has no problem with pee. This has actually been the case since she was a baby, a wet diaper never bothered her, and I think that stuck. She's incredibly verbal, and we've had loads of discussions where her reasoning is sound, i.e. ""I was busy"" ""I wanted to change my underwear"" ""I already had an accident today so I won't get chocolate anyway"" (I can see the limitations of bribery here). We've sat down to have talks, she agrees with us about going in the potty, but it doesn't seem to stick. She does a little better at daycare, but they've said their method is asking her constantly, which when we do that she gets really annoyed with us and seems to actually resist more. 

It's now been a year, and I've scoured the internet for advice, but most of it is focused on the training part. She's trained, just doesn't seem to be motivated to stay dry. I will take any and all advice, even if it's admonishment of our .",1

1987,"My girlfriend (22F) had a WEIRD reaction to me (20M) coming out as bi Even though I’ve known my girlfriend my whole life and I know she’s not homophobic at all, I prepared for a lot of different reactions. This is my first relationship and I didn’t really mean to keep this from her, but I was really embarrassed and kept convincing myself I wasn’t really for years.

Anyway, I was surprised because she just said “okay,” but she sounded pretty upset. I was kind of afraid what would happen if I pushed, so I changed the topic. Up until this afternoon, she was avoiding me, giving these really empty responses when we would talk, etc.

Eventually I asked if I upset her when I came out and she just said “I don’t want to hear that you’re attracted to other people. Did you really think I’d be okay with you announcing you’re attracted to other people?” That feels so weird because it’s really everyone attracted to other people? I assume she’s attracted to other men but neither of us act on it because we love each other.

I apologized and she just told me she never wants to hear about it again, but she’ll try to forgive me and warm back up to me eventually.

2885,"I have a gut feeling to leave I (20F) live with my (23M) boyfriend. I moved in after no longer wanting to be a student and I couldn’t live with family anymore due to problems. I had to move cities and it’s very different to me and I basically feel alone a lot of the time. We have been together for around 2 years and been living together for a year and 5 months. It may seem quick that we moved in together but we knew each other very well before that. 

We live with his mum and we are trying to save up for a house which would be around next year id say. I have a new job which is much better than before and really working for us. Things are really tough though and it has not been one huge thing to cause this feeling of leaving but I’d say re occurring small things. 

He is the type of person to get angry and get in “moods” over VERY small things like leaving the door open, not hearing what he is saying, food too cold etc. Since I’ve been here i have seen what he is like more and especially around his mother. He swears at her a lot and you can tell he doesn’t appreciate much from her - I have told him to not be so rude and maybe not call her names because it hurts me but nothing has changed. It makes me think that he will be like this to me in a few years but he said he won’t. 🤷🏼‍♀️

I’ve just really had enough lately and I cannot be bothered to try and get him out of his “moods” over things so small. And these things happen like 4 times a day. To him he thinks that I don’t  care about him anymore but I just don’t think that dealing with these things are worth it and they just end up ruining my moods.

Most recently we have fought because he was mentioning something that I was doing that bothered him which is fine but he said a specific word and I asked him could you not use that word because it does really hurt me and he continued to say the same word for like 10 times. I understood what he was saying and his point but I didn’t understand why he had to say the word that hurt me again and again like it was very easy to rephrase. I just felt like he wanted to hurt me on purpose. Anyways that problem is solved kinda.

He just recently keeps calling me names and I just let it slide because I have no energy to mention it or say it hurts because it just won’t result in anything. I have told him previously when you do specific things like 1,2,3 they hurt me and he would apologise and say he won’t do it again but do it two weeks later so I don’t see the point in apologising. I would appreciate more if he is honest and say he will try or something like that. 

I wouldn’t mind if he does it and apologise once he has realised he has done it but he would just make an excuse and say he did it because he wanted me to listen or something. Basically what I’m hearing is that I’m hurting you on purpose but oh well. 

Sometimes he also looks at me and has a look of like disgust and I’ve mentioned this to him but he has no idea what I’m talking about. Maybe I am overthinking it but sometimes I just get that feeling and it makes me a bit insecure.

I have also told him recently that I no longer want to live with him and would rather move out alone and be by myself because I feel like I need it. He doesn’t really understand and he is trying to be better to convince me but I think I’ve made my mind.

Point is do I listen to this feeling inside of me of moving out alone or just work this out. I feel like I’ve reached my limit and I don’t want to try anymore because I was doing so much in the start of the relationship and to be honest it is a lot of work and I feel so mentally exhausted of this cycle of getting hurt every two weeks. I’ve tried to communicate how I feel and I just get filled with false promises.
I’m so over everything now that I don’t care what he says about me when he’s angry because I know it’s not worth it and I’d rather just take it - like just last week he was angry at me so he called me unappreciative and stupid and then three days later he said he didn’t mean it but whatever.

I do love him so much and I don’t want to be with anyone else but him, at the same time though do I need to selfish and think of myself first? And if I move out would we stop be together or am I still going to feel exhausted ? 


TL;DR I feel exhausted and think I want to live alone instead of buying a house with my boyfriend so what do I do?",0

TW - sexual content 

After recovering from a breakup from an abusive relationship, I decided to dip my feet back into the dating pool. I agreed to a date with someone I matched with and with whom I shared mutual friends and we went out to dinner &amp; a movie. At the end of the movie, he kissed me. The kiss grew more intense, and he groped my crotch. At the time I was shocked and confronted, but dismissed it as 'nothing' and when the kiss ended and he said, 'Back to mine' I muttered a meek yes. It sounds awfully naive, but I was very innocent at the time having basically no dating experience. So in my mind, my yes was a yes to 'would you like to keep talking and getting to know one another.' Besides the grope, everything had been fine so I didn't mind chatting a little longer.

When we were walking outside though, in a cocky way, this man said, 'Tonight's been good, but it's going to get better.' Oh heck. I thought. Heck. Heck. Heck. He wants SEX! On a first date! I couldn't believe it! I was not that kind of girl, I'd even been very clear in our original messaging that I had high values and physical intimacy was something very important to me, to have it on the table early. I disassociated at this point; I remember walking down the street but feeling like the world around me was lethargic and surreal. When we got the cars, I asked him to stop, I had to tell him something. Mustering my courage I said, 'I don't mind vising your house for a bit, but I don't want to do anything physical. Plus I'm on my period anyway.' I thought that would be a sufficient deterrent and it seemed to be. 'That's fine,' he said, 'Let's watch a TV show.' At the time, I was glad of his respect. I was stupid to agree to visit, but I'd already agreed and felt obliged.

We kissed a bit more, and chatted a bit, albeit in a bit of a sexualised flirty way - but I'd already set my boundary so naively I thought I would be safe. When we arrived at the house, I went inside and was expecting to sit on a couch, have respectful conversation and watch an episode and leave. Instead, he got inside, bypassed the seats and tv because it was 'too small' to sit on &amp; v-lined straight to the bed and before I knew it, he'd stripped of his clothes! What! Why was this happening! I froze at that moment. A true, honest: can't think, can't speak, can't operate threat response freeze. 'You don't have to take yours off, I just don't like clothes in bed.' (apparently he thought I would stay over, but he'd never asked me about that). I barely registered what he said. The world felt so overwhelming to deal with. This wasn't what I agreed to. 'You right?' he basically laughed at me, in that cocky voice. 'Yeah,' I muttered in the freeze state. Then stood still some more. But he was moving and I couldn't stay there forever. I could speak to leave. I couldn't move. All I could think was do something. Do SOMETHING. And suddenly, unconsciously, I took off my dress and went on the bed. I have no idea why I did that.

He tried to get the Ipad to watch a show, but then I squeaked, totally consumed with anxiety, can't we talk. Stupidly, I tried to do 'get to know you' chat. Looking back, he was barely into it. We kissed and cuddled some more. The next question was to take my bra off, so he could 'touch my back' better. I said wait, spent a few moments in total panic, then complied. There was so much anxiety in me at this point: how the hell was I in this situation after I set that boundary? Overwhelmed, panicked, stressed, what I did next was unthinkable. It felt like a compulsion, I touched his crouch - 'is this okay?' 'How about your mouth?' he said. No. This was it. Why was this happening. Why? Why? 'Do you have a condom?' I asked, a last-ditch effort. He expressed disdain at my period. Holy shit. No! I didn't want to have sex. No, not sex, no no no! I said... I said weakly, 'STDs.' I don't have any, he said. And then my last defense was gone. And I was numb, and anxious and borderline disassociated again and I felt totally as if I hadn't an option. And so I complied.

In the encounter that followed, I was choked, ask him to stop, and later was choked again. I asked not to be 'mouth fucked' (a disgusting term) and I was. In denial, trying to save myself the shame of getting myself in this stupid, compromising situation, I timidly said I didn't usually do this (I NEVER did this! EVER!), I tried to talk of another date to lessen my anxiety. When I implied that I would leave soon, it was implied that if I left he'd get 'blue balls' and 'cry' - I felt trapped. When I did get to leave and go home, it took a while for events to come into focus.

This wasn't right, was it?",0
1459,"2 years in it and I still regret it and I want to die I thought things would just get better over time and that the post partum depression would just eventually go away.

My son will soon turn 2 and I still regret having a child. Dealing with his constant crying, frustrations, the struggle to do anything with him and looking after him during lockdowns or when he is sick is just too much. No family/friends support as we are immigrants (both my parents and MIL also passed away). 

I try to be my best dad version and it's a huge effort I need to put in to fake it properly. 

Worst decision in my life and killing myself seems like the only way out. 

Will this eventually start to get better?

Looking at him smiling or photos of him makes me feel like shit and that he deserves better. I do love him, but I can't understand this kind of love/regret feelings.

Will things eventually start to fall in its place? Or do I have to continue to endure this sort of nightmare? Will I eventually wake up from it?

2837,"My girlfriend wants to live together with her sister a couple of times a week My (26) GF (25) and her sister (24) have since they were young almost always lived together, in the same apartment and the same bed. Since about 8 months ago, they were split up due to study reasons and the sister lived with their parents since that time and this is when I met my girlfriend. We spend a lot of time (basically 24/7 since we met) and we have lived together and slept together every night for the last 4 months. We have travelled a lot and lived in a lot of different places, the last place we were at was at my GF and her sisters old apartment but her sister is now back in that apartment which is why we now live at my apartment, which I enjoy. I live about 2 blocks from her sisters apartment.

My girlfriend feels sort of pity for her sister who now has to sleep alone and now wants to sleep with her sister at her place a couple of times a week, which seems like a regression for our relationship since sleeping is one of the more intimate times that we spend together. I've argued that I feel that it is not healthy for siblings in their mid-20s to sleep in the same bed and live together like that and she needs to let her sister go and let her be used to it once and for all (my GF lived alone for about a year a 3-4 years ago, but her sister has never lived alone). My GF argues that she feels sorry for her sister and wants her sister not to be alone and but gradually sleep less and less till she lives alone but I have trouble seeing this transition be successful. I accept her opinion but I don't think it would be healthy for her and my relationship.

I don't know how to approach it. How do I convince my girlfriend that she should let her sister sleep alone?

2463,"Advice on how to set boundaries with my best friend Hello. This is my first time posting in this community and English is not my first language so please be kind.

I (F18) have a friend (F19) that has trouble making friends. We went to different schools our whole lives but became close because our moms were friends. For a little background, when she was in school she had one or two friends for a short period of time and then they stopped hanging out. She would be left alone in school and the cycle continued when she befriended someone else. I am her only constant friend and honestly I don’t get why. She’s funny and creative and really fun to be around with.

When we were both in school we would see eachother like once a week and talked about everything. When we saw eachother she always complained about something new (usually about her friends) but we still had fun. But that changed when we both started college. She moved to another city and has been having a hard time. 

I’m taking around 26 hours of classes a week and work for 28. Most of my time I spend between those things or hanging out with my friends and boyfriend. I also study a lot. My parents tell me that I should quit since they pay for my university but I want to prove to myself that I can do it. The thing is, between that and exercising I only get around 1 hour a day to myself.

I really cherish this one hour. I watch tv, paint my nails or whatever. But my friend insists on calling me as soon as I get off at work (around 9 pm). And it’s not just to check up on me or ask me about my day. Its to complain about the same thing she always talks about. How people don’t understand her in her classes or how nobody’s creative enough or good enough to be her friend. Sometimes it gets annoying when I realize I’m spending all my time listening to her.

I would love to talk to her about something else but she has literally no one else to vent to. I don’t know what to do I feel really guilty and like a bad friend for not wanting to talk to her. Sometimes I even pretend that I’m busy just so I don’t have to listen. 

Please give me some advice on how to talk to her about this.",0
2844,"I (28 M) and going on a first date with a girl (29 F) some things feel like they're coming unstitched. Advice please! Met a great girl on tinder a few months ago. We live an hour away but she's across the border so we are just now getting ready to meet next weekend since the border to Canada is open now. 

In the past few days she's switched from saying she will probably want to cuddle (she said that about a month ago)  to saying we probably won't cuddle.  The texts I get from her have gotten a bit shorter too. 

We will be at her house for majority of it. She asked if I was comfortable having a few of her friends come over for a little bit. She said if i wasn't comfortable meeting new people she would tell them not to. She did say though they likely won't be there too long. It's her place so I obviously won't tell her no. Plus maybe it's because she's a little nervous since we have never met in person and I'll be in her house. 

She did invite me to stay over in the guest room if I want to drink with her while there. 

She seems happy that I'm going over and I'm happy too. But at the same time, it feels like some things are starting to come unstitched such as the shorter texts from her and her change on wanting to cuddle(maybe just nerves?)  Does anyone have any advice or input?   Any is appreciated!

Tldr: going on a date with a great girl and I don't know what to think about some of the changes happening.",0
2495,"How do I (24F) deal with my boyfriend (25M) not looking into the future? First about me. I'm currently in my final year of university and especially as a mature student, I feel very pressured to move on with my life. I study abroad so I live with a host family, but I feel like I'm starting to overstay my welcome so I am planning to move out soon. 

About him and our relationship. We've known each other for 2 years and have been together for a year and 10 months. He's from the same country where I study. He currently lives with his 63 year old mother. He's very close to her, she's his only family, and he wants to pay her back for all the things she's done by buying her a house (they're currently renting).

I have told him about my wishes to move out from my current situation and if there's any possibility of us living together. He said if he buys a house, I'm welcome to live with him and his mother. I like his mother and although others have pointed out this is weird, I would genuinely like this. This was a few months ago.

Pressure is building up for me so I've recently asked him again how the situation is going. He said they're not anywhere closer to buying a house. I understand this process takes time, but when I asked if they're looking or saving money, he was being vague. I then asked if he wanted to live in an apartment with me and he got mad, saying I'd make him give up his dream of buying a house.

I'm currently planning to rent a room in shared living with strangers. I'm a bit worried, but this is pretty common amongst students and I'm excited about meeting new people. I've asked him again how long he thinks it would take for us to be able to move our relationship along, but he said he doesn't know. He does keep saying he wants to live together, but doesn't think it's an option for a while now. I understand there are obstacles but he doesn't seem to have a plan and when I ask where he sees us in 5 years, he says he can't even imagine himself in 5 years. I would be okay with waiting months or even another year if only I had some kind of direction.

I do love him and believe he loves me, but I feel lost in so many aspects of my life, and I'm unsure how to deal with this sense of directionlessness especially coming from him. If it were up to me, I would plan out the next 10 years of our life together, but he's not the kind of person to want to be confined like that.

Anyone got any advice on how I can deal with our differences in approaching the future? Any own experiences are also greatly appreciated. Thank you!",0
794,13 months boy still waking up at night. Our boy would wake up sitting up crying. These events would happen a few times throughout the night. Waking up like this has happened since birth. He would also toss and turn as if he was very unrested. We checked his skin to see if there’s any irritation. He does have Exzema but the doctor has given meds but he’s still waking up. He’s not hungry because he doesn’t drink the bottle much. Takes a couple chugs and goes back to sleep. More of a comfort thing. So tonight I held him in the rocking chair to see if he would still wake up or toss or turn as often. He seems more rested doesn’t wake up as often. Sometimes whimpering but not like mentioned above. He would have some jerks in his body sometimes. Seems like a bad dream or something.,1

225,"Bewildered by Son at Preschool My 2.5 year old wild child started preschool two days a week last week at a carefully chosen, wonderful school. I have been SO excited for him because he is such a social, friendly kid that, thanks to the pandemic, has had very little opportunity to actually be social. He’s constantly hugging kids at the park, asking people to “go play!” My own mom won’t keep him overnight because he’s so wild and talkative it exhausts her! {she isn’t in great health} 

All that to say that he was MADE for preschool. We went to Meet the Teacher Night and he barely noticed we were there he was so excited to play. On the first day of school we dropped him off and he was happy as could be to go in and “play with friends”. That afternoon, though, when I picked him up he was a little bit subdued. The next school day he cried and cried about not wanting to go and I was so confused but thought, hey, he knows I’m leaving, he’s still getting used to school. He’ll have a great day.

His teacher sent me an email over the weekend, though, in response to me asking how he was doing and told me that he has hardly said two words to anyone. She said they call him The Contemplator because he just hangs back and watches everything around him. It was like she was talking about a different kid! I know children can be different at school than they are around their parents but I was so confused! She then posted some pictures in the class Facebook group and every single kid was playing and dancing and having a good time—except for my kid who was sitting down on the side of the room by himself. 

My best friend, whose son is in the class too, even mentioned to me that “that’s so unlike him.”

Has anyone else had this experience with a social wild child suddenly being completely subdued in a school environment? My husband had a really hard childhood because he never spoke to other kids and refused to interact socially. I don’t think he even had a friend until midway through high school. 

We’ve wondered if maybe he’s having a hard time adjusting to having rules and structure because at home, while he does have rules and structure, he’s still the only child here so has pretty undivided attention. 

I’d love to hear any insight from any of you! Thank you so much!",1

2687,"Overcoming Unrequited Love for my (22M) Best Friend (23F) I've never posted anything on Reddit before, however, I am looking to get some advice on a situation that I am going through.

I have been close friends with a girl who lives a few houses down from me for a little over a year, and I recently told her that I wanted to cut contact with her because my feelings were just too strong.

We originally met on Tinder, and after a few dates, she made it clear that she did not see the romantic chemistry between us (fair enough). Fast forward a few months, and we have become best friends, working out together, spending all our free time together, and supporting each other in everything we do. I can honestly say that this person is the greatest friend I could ever ask for, and she has my utmost respect; however, a part of me kept longing for more. Things were great, and I felt as though I was getting more comfortable with the prospect of being friends, that was until she would bring up her interest in dating and meeting new people. It just felt so crushing to know that others had the potential to achieve what I had longed for so much, and I felt myself getting more and more stressed as time passed. 

I do not think of myself as someone who gets envious of others trying to find happiness, however, these feelings began to surface more regularly in regards to this person. It truly hurt my heart, as I would never want anyone to think/feel this towards me, and here I was having these feelings towards my best friend.

Throughout the year I had periods where I was able to completely ignore these feelings, and in those times, my life, and my relationship with her were great, however, as time passed, we kept coming back to these old conversations and feelings that apparently never healed. Finally, it got to the point where I decided that we should take a break. We were both very sad it came to this, but she was happy that I was taking steps towards bettering me, and I feel like this had to happen eventually.

She is potentially the greatest friend I will ever have in my life, and it upsets me to think that because of my emotional immaturity things had to go the way they did. I want to get to a point in my life where I can accept our friendship for what it is, and not go searching for more. I had found something great, and I'm a better person for it, I really hope we can go back to the way things were (minus the attraction I felt to her) but I can't help but feel that things will never be the same.

I guess the questions I'm asking are this: has anyone experienced something like this before, is there any way that we can go on being friends, how do I deal with completely changing the relationship between my best friend and I",0
646,"Recommendations on how to teach kids about people who are worse off than them? Hi all,

Looking for a bit of advice. My stepchildren are very privileged. They're not brats by any means, but they live in two (ours and their moms) very nice houses in nice areas. They have nice clothes, a decent amount of toys, do extra curricular activities, and have (monitored) streaming services, Xbox, Switch etc on tap.  It's all in moderation, and they don't have every single thing they want. But they don't go without either. 

We've noticed recently that one of them in particular has not been ungrateful as such, but we can tell that he doesn't realize how lucky he is, either. 

Of course we don't want him to feel like he has to be like ""I must eat this entire plate of food because there are starving children in the world"" but we'd like to gently open his (and his siblings) eyes to other kids/peoples situations be it homelessness or simply not having enough money to have Netflix or give the kids the foods they want. 

But we're a bit stuck on how to teach them about those things in a child appropriate manner so they don't feel bad or guilty about having nice things or experiences, but we'd like them to have a little more compassion for others and before they complain that Disney Plus wont update, to just take a step back and realize that it's not the worst thing in the world. 

I hope that's come across ok, the goal isn't to make them feel like crap, just raising awareness in a child-friendly way. Has anybody else been through something similar with their kiddos, or have any advice or kid-appropriate eye openers?",1
1072,"Please help My son is 3 and a half. He uses the potty fine with peeing, but absolutely refuses to poop in the potty. The first and only time he pooped in the potty was months ago. I gave him so much positive reinforcement, and we started serious potty training after that. Well, he was doing OK, but regressed at school since his (now former) teacher did not make him go if he told her no, and so he would regularly have accidents, which forced us to go back to pull ups. Well, he started preK (first of 2 years in preK, he is in a program for speech and language therapy) and his new teacher makes him go (or at least try), and ever since then, he's been golden, give or take maybe 2 peeing accidents. Totally different story with pooping. Ever since he was around 2, he would basically never poop at daycare. He always waited until he was home. This is still the case. He hardly ever poops at school, but if he does, it's in his pants. At this point, he has pooped in so many pairs of underwear. I used to take off his pants as soon as we got in the door at home, so he would hopefully be more aware of it if he started to accidentally go on himself, and for motivation to keep his nice big boy underwear clean. That clearly didn't work, so I've been having him strip completely naked from the waist down once we get home, and also have him sit on the potty around the time he will usually go. If he's been sitting on the potty for a long time with no poop, I allow him to go play, and if he needs to go, I hope that he will go to the potty on his own, since I have made it overwhelmingly clear that is what he needs to do. That's actually how things worked out the first and only time he pooped in the potty. Well, lots of times he will just hold it, and never go. Any time he has ever pooped his pants at school, it is because of this.. Anyway, we got home today and I stripped him completely from the waist down, encouraged him to poop in the potty (I also bribe him with treats/positive reinforcement), made him sit on the potty when it got a bit later, but ultimately, with no success. Well, tonight around 9pm, I was winding down for the night, and he wanted us to do some yoga before we went to bed. I was in such a mood where I was looking forward to relax and lose myself into the practice for a bit. I was not even 3 minutes in until I see my son in the corner of our living room, randomly start to pee on the floor, and then proceed to drop a shit. At first, I was so taken aback that it took a while to sink in, and I was close to doing one of those chuckles you do when you're in such disbelief, but I was way too upset for that, especially since this is really my last resort. I have no other ideas. Has anyone else had issues with their kid refusing to poop in the potty?? I was so freaking livid, and yes, I scolded him... I even held the poop up to his face when I picked it up (with a few baby wipes) to flush it in the toilet... I believe he needs to realize how not ok that is. That is behavior that I will not shrug off. However, the thing that makes me sad is that I understand he isn't doing this to be intentionally bad... he genuinely seems to have some kind of issue with pooping in the potty, but I have no clue what it could be. He was completely like this with peeing in the potty as well, until he moved up to preK, where his teacher didn't give him a choice.... so there is good reason to believe he's just being stubborn, but what for?? This isn't normal. I make him go at home too, and he pees in the potty, no problem. I'm just so stuck here. Can someone please help? I'm feeling so defeated, and I'm at a complete loss. 

TLDR: 3 year old refuses to poop in the potty. I've tried positive reinforcement, having him strip from the waist down as soon as we get home, and have him sit on the potty for a while around the time he will usually go. No luck. I'm desperate.",1
3114,"My mom(48) does nothing everyday but sit and lay down and use the social media all day, She doesn't even talk to us, She gets mad for the little chores here. My mom really does nothing here.

My dad talked to her about these issues for like everyday yet she does not comply or realize the magnitude of the situation.

1612,"My (19F) father has been confronting me endlessly about my weight despite my history and pleas for them to stop. I don't know what to do. There's a lot of context for this story so sorry if it is a heavy read.

I have had a lengthy relationship with body dysmorphia and disordered eating. I have had impulsive problems with disordered eating since I was 12. I was a  healthy child, nowhere near overweight, but social pressures and childhood bullying instilled it in me. It didn't get severe until I was about 14-15, right around the time I was formally diagnosed with depression, anorexia, and bulimia and hospitalized. I was was 106 pounds, putting me underweight for my height at the time (5'6). I was abusing laxatives, etc. I recovered for the most part, but between then and 2020 I still had thoughts and ongoing problems that I worked on until I stopped therapy in 2019. 

Flash forward to early 2020 when I started my first semester of community college. I had just moved states and was going through a pretty hard time emotionally. I was eating a lot, but it worked itself out because I was getting outside and walking/running every day. I was on campus. Then, COVID restrictions hit, and I kept up the eating habits but stopped exercising. That's when the weight gain began, and I gained 40 pounds between February and December, settling at 160 (I am 5 foot 7). December was right around the time my parents started to comment on my weight (also the time I got into a relationship). I was out of the house most of the time living with a friend during the fall, so they hadn't really made as many comments then. I came back home in late November and suddenly everything became about my weight.

At this point, I had been pretty okay with my weight gain. I still had my bad days but they were always fleeting. Then, my dad started talking about it nonstop. He would or comments like ""you're a chubster now"" or ""All the boys would think you're so pretty if you were thin"" and how ""you have such a nice body, you just need to lose weight and you'll be so sexy to all the boys your age"". My mom would not make comments but would enable my dad. I started gaining weight again around January as my stress eating continued. Almost every single conversation I was having with my mom and dad was about food, and it became all I could think about. I gained 15 pounds and was pretty overweight for about a month until my parents held an ""intervention"". My dad suggested I go on a diet. He told me he would pay me 700 dollars if I got my weight down to 120. He suggested I go on keto. At this point, my self-loathing was pretty high, and all I wanted was to be thin again. I agreed in hopes it would appease him, even though my brother berated him for essentially creating an outline for how to worsen an eating disorder. At the time I saw it as a way to make some additional money while I was working while achieving my goal of becoming ""normal"" again. I lost a lot of weight quickly from dieting, and around March I was down to 140, the lowest I had been since I was 17. 

Even so, I was miserable. My life became about counting calories again, and when I didn't see the progress I liked I would resort to my old habits of purging and fasting. I would spend hours taking pictures of the parts of my body I hated and standing in front of the mirror. I became obsessive. I started abusing dangerous drugs that suppressed my appetite. I have been addicted to those drugs and the weight loss and feeling that they provide since then. It's been destroying my brain, but the validation (especially from my dad) keeps me going. My boyfriend since December saw it even though I refused to talk about it, and would try and get me to eat or tell me how I didn't need to lose weight, especially not on their terms. I'd believe it for a while until I went back home.

Eventually, I started eating normally again. My weight settled at 150. I told my parents I was done and that it was destroying me mentally. My mother let it go, as she had noticed my stress and anxiety increasing, but my dad didn't let up so easily. He told me how I could stop doing keto but I still needed to lose weight or I am going to die young. He got me a gym membership for my 19th birthday. I felt it was a generous gift but also backhanded. The constant jokes and comments continued. 

Recently I have stopped spending time at home. The times that I do see my dad are passive-aggressive interactions about how I'm either eating too fast or eating too much. I purge every day that I am at home. He says ""he's not trying to be controlling, he just wants me to be happy"". I argue with him and tell him to stop. I've told him I want to be able to eat without him judging my every move, but he always protests. Our arguments have become more frequent but I always let him win because I'm emotionally exhausted. Meanwhile, at my boyfriend's house, I've been losing weight steadily and eating healthy, and for the most part, laying off of the substances. 

My parents complain that I am never home, but I hate how I feel when I am there. I don't sleep, I just sit in my room and think. My dad caught me purging once and stated ""see how much less bloated you are now that it got out?"". He has even told me that managing my weight comes before school; that my weight/health should be my top priority. My mom yelled at him for the first time when he said that. 

All this being said, I don't want to ruin my relationship with him or my mom. I love my dad, warts and all. I know he is just worried. He used to be very overweight himself and has some severe eating problems as well, always calling himself fat despite the fact that he's on the low side of normal. My brother became obese during COVID, and I know he does not want me to go down the same road. He doesn't have much control over that situation, but I guess he feels he has control over me. 

At the same time, it's quite literally killing me. My self-loathing is at an all-time high. My anxiety has increased greatly. My weight is fluctuating rapidly. My grades have dropped since the spring semester; I used to be a 4.0 student with honors, but I withdrew from most of my spring classes because of the mounting stress. I'm still going to graduate on time if this stress doesn't hinder me further, but it's breaking me the more I stay at home. I don't really have a permanent place I can live at the moment, so it's inevitable for me to see my parents. Every time I'm at home with my dad, I feel like if I start eating or stop taking the drugs I will become overweight again and hate myself even more. I'm scared this is going to happen until I inevitably die shortly. My body and mind have been deteriorating because of this situation. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. I would like to lose weight for myself, but not like this. I don't have anyone in my life besides my family, my boyfriend, and two friends who are also college students and who I can't burden with this. Any help is appreciated. Sorry if this is above Reddit's paygrade.

2466,"Frustrated with my (26M) Girlfriend's (22F) and I's sex life after almost a year of trying to communicate and resolve our issues. My girlfriend and I have been together for just over 4 years now, living together for just over 2, and we've had issues develop in our sex life in the past year that I'm concerned can't be resolved.

We had sex for the first time about 4 months into our relationship. I was her first and since then we had a pretty satisfying sex life given our circumstances. I had two more years of college to finish and she took 2 years off college to help her family with a bunch of stuff. I'd make the drive down to see her every 2 or 3 weekends and spend the whole weekend with her. We'd usually have sex once or twice during visits and pretty often over the extended summer stays, and I was wholly happy with the amount of sex and what we got up to.

Two years into dating I graduated college and moved down to by where I went to school. She chose to join me moving in since she wanted to start college and by this point she wanted to get away from her family drama, or at least not live with them to avoid the drama that caused. For the first year we lived together sex was again pretty consistent and satisfying. We tried new things and did it frequently, with her engaging plenty and showing interest.

Things started to decline near late fall last year. We both discussed her getting on birth control for the sake of forging a condom. I know thats me asking her to take on the responsibility of contraception, and in a more medical manner with more side effects, but I was upfront that sex without a condom felt much better. I also didn't just ask her to start taking pills, I told her I want to start looking into other contraceptive methods and I'd be open to paying half or more for her to get an IUD or even getting a vasectomy since I really don't feel like I want kids. I told her all the options and that picking one route of condomless sex was important for my enjoyment. I left the decision up to her since I felt it would impact her the most if she chose one of the option affecting her body and I didn't mind getting snipped. She chose birth control pills as the method and got a prescription.

The first time we had sex without a condom with her on birth control she cried and we stopped. She said she felt like our relationship was in a rough spot and it felt disingenuous to have sex at the point. I asked her what made her feel like that and she said me wanting to have condomless sex made her feel like sex was make or break for us.

I was upfront with her. I told her that yeas, sex is important to me. It absolutely isn't the main reason I'm with her, but I am a sexual person who wants to have sex with their partner. I also told her that I get taking pills is something I'm putting on her and I reiterated that I'd be willing to get a vasectomy if she really didn't want to keep taking pills. We talked it out more and she said she was just overreacting to some other stressors in her life and got freaked out by how much I was looking forward to not using a condom and seeing it as me being happy she was finally ""good enough"".  We ironed that out seemingly.

Over the next couple months she stopped instigating completely, and would very frequently forget to take her birth control. This lead to us having sex only once more from September to January 2021. I brought it up to her and told her that it was bugging me that we weren't having sex anymore and felt unhappy about it, but more importantly I'd like to work with her to resolve and discuss whatever was bugging her about it. She said she felt really stressed as of recent with her semester ending and the holidays and just didn't have the headspace to want to have sex. She said that she was stressed and felt like she wasn't ever able to get into the mood to have sex or enjoy it, so she always rejected the proposals. I asked what would help and she simply told me that she needs more headspace to want to have sex. I read up on the matter and found some articles on ""spontaneous"" vs ""reactionary"" sex drives, which basically outlined that some people get horny independent of what else is going on in their minds and some people need really clear headspace to have the chance to get horny. It all boiled down to her needing more headspace and she was upfront that me proposing sex, even once every week or two, was stressful with her feeling like she felt obligated. I laid off proposing it and we ended up not having sex until early March of 2021. We went about 6 months without sex in total then.

When we did it again we only did it twice. Both times I felt incredibly nervous and didn't finish the first time because I felt very self conscious and incredibly strung out, like this was a super rare opportunity and I was both overexcited and unenthused. She broke down again after the second time and said that she was scared I'd leave her if she ever stopped feeling sexual. I tried to be upfront but I just felt broken about the subject by that point. I felt like no matter what I said this would never be fixed and I just felt so bad for having sexual feelings at all with how she was reacting. She asked if I'd ever leave her if she decided she never wanted to have sex again and I told her I would stay with her, a lie in retrospect. Again, I just felt so broken and guilty at that point and I started to feel gross in my own body for having sexual feelings with her responding like this. We talked it out more and she said she wasn't ace, she just had this doom and gloom concern over a worst case scenario. I kind of nodded along at this point.

Since then, March until now, things have hardly improved. We have sex maybe once a month, and have done it maybe 10 times in total in 2021. She's only instigated once in that entire time frame. I instigate much more often but the majority of the time she turns me down. Whenever I ask her she spends a sloid 30+ minutes being coy and avoiding the subject and building tension. She says she does that because if she's not 100% raring to go before I proposition she needs to spend time thinking if she'll get horny or feel horny enough to enjoy it. Whenever we do it we stick to the most basic positions and she doesn't even attempt foreplay anymore. Half the time she'll start a goofy conversation before we lay down and just continue it while I do any foreplay and talk over me asking her to do anything to me, or just half paying attention when doing anything to me. Whenever I ask to try anything new she either turns it down or ignores me and pretends she didn't hear me.

I just hate it now. I hate sex and I feel so fucking gross in my own body whenever I get aroused. I feel so much anxiety at the half our minute of her going nearly mute and awkward cuddling while she decides if she wants to, leaving me feeling even more gross if she doesn't want to. I look at anythign sexual and feel anxiety correlating it to her crying or panicking about sex. I hate feeling aroused because I feel so anxious and gross but I can't help feeling stimulated. Even getting myself off just feels disgusting.

We had sex again this last weekend and it's finally reached the point where even that feels gross to me. She wasn't super into it so she just kept looking away and half responding to me. I felt no emotional connection and I felt like I was using her. I haven't had any desire to sleep with her again since and after starting to get aroused today I just felt like I was having a mild panic attack.

Our relationship has been really great outside of our sex life. We've achieved a lot of life milestones together, integrated into each other families, and we communicate really well outside of sexual topics. Part of why I feel so gross is I care about her so much outside of sex and I'm terrified of hurting her. 

I've tried to discuss with her many times through the year and every time our conversations lead to the exact same place of her being stressed about things, or she just gets super quiet and shuts down to the point it's a one sided conversation until I change the subject. I've tried to ask her and discuss doing things that she really likes, asking her what foreplay she likes, any positions, acts, instigations, ANYTHING that would enhance the experience for her, but she ""has no clue"" to all those questions. Couples coinciding would be great, but we can't afford it and the only big issue is sex.

What should I do? I really want to stay with her but this last year has made me disgusted and anxious of my own body and urges and I'm just not sure what else to do to try and fix any of this. I want to get back to a point where we have sex 1-3 times a week and enjoy it, but I feel like she'll never enjoy sex again. I'm concerned that things will never improve and as our relationship ages she'll reach the point of never wanting to have sex again.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing to answer an inevitable question, no she was never sexually assaulted. Without going into too much detail she'd be very upfront if she had before or during us dating, and I'd especially know if she had during us dating.",0

632,"Daughter just doesn’t feel like pooping. I have a three year old. We’ve been dealing with her not wanting to poop basically since she’s been born. It’s not that’s she’s constipated, I don’t even know if I’d call it stool withholding. She just… doesn’t want to poop. 

She won’t poop for days until I tell her “if you don’t poop on your own I’m going to help you poop” (suppository). She hates the suppository so much she’ll say to me “no, I’ll poop by myself!” And go sit on the potty and poop right then and there. Like she can poop on command!

I don’t understand this at all and it’s frustrating me to hell. Her poop is soft. She eats lots of fruits/veg, exercise, drinks water. She will let her belly get enormous and hard but will never poop unless I mention it. When she poops it’s huge and stinky but is soft like I said. She shows no signs of it hurting her or any adverse behavior during the act of pooping. Potty training was easy peasy and she learned with no struggle at all. She just… won’t go on her own. Then the cycle comes, I threaten her, she sits on the potty and poops on command.

3125,"I strongly dislike my adopted mother. For the purposes of being succinct I will be referring to my adopted mother as ""AM"" and my adopted dad as dad. I'm 29M.

I was adopted at 8 days old by a kind couple who had issues conceiving. Cue AM and dad. At 3 years old my mother explained how I came to be in probably the most wholesome way ever. I figured out what she meant when I was 7-8 years old and being adopted has never bothered me.

However I recently learned that she was withholding pretty crucial information from me about my biological parents. Apparently back when I was 5 my BPs tried to reach out in hopes of entering and being a part of my life (whether near or from afar). My AM, without telling anyone including my dad, responded to them with a stern no. My AM and whoever (it was never clear which parent it was) exchanged not 2, not 3, but 25 letters between them over the course of about 8 months. The final letter from my BPs was expressing how they were going to be forwarding their contact details to us, which they never did. I just found all of this out about a week ago, finished talking to my AM last night and plan on going LC or NC. 

Her excuse for not telling me 24 years ago was because she ""didn't want me to think I wanted that"". 

I'm so lost. The only mother figure I've ever had has been lying to me for basically my entire life and idk what to do. I go to therapy once a week and even my therapist doesn't know how to console me right now. How the hell would you handle it?

1828,"My (22M) mom (50F) is a COVID 19 anti-vaxer and my dad (60M) is pressuring me get the vaccine since everything is closing down for unvaccinated people in my country Hi everyone. I've never thought I'd be posting in this subreddit but things aren't going as planned and I've really been struggling for a couple months to make the right decision. For everyone's best interest, a bit of context is indeed needed to get a full picture of the situation I'm currently in right now.

I'm an only child. I've always been really close to my parents and family since as far as I can remember and I'm sorta a ""Mama's boy"" if you catch my drift. She's always made clear that if something were to happen to me, she wouldn't be able to live without me. That being said, she's not one of those crazy moms we see on TV/podcast/etc, meaning she isn't controlling my life in any shape or form, but she's an emotional, loving and caring mother that always wanted the best for me. My mom has never been an antivax before and always pushed me to get all the latest vaccines and all of that regular crap. That all changed tho when Covid came outta nowhere in our lives. At first she seemed pretty normal about how things were going but when the first vaccines rolled out, she was really sceptical about its real ""effectiveness"" for lack of a better term. I think its also worth pointing out that my mom is always on her phone going through Facebook, YouTube and online in general. She's been reading a whole bunch of stuff online about how ""vaccines are killing people"" or ""how it kills our immune system"" and all of that rabbit hole and it definitely took a turn on her perception of those vaccines. Now, she isn't the only one with that antivax mentality. Her whole family side, meaning my aunt, uncle, step dad and grandmother all share the same opinion about the vaccines. I've tried multiple times to resonate with every single one of them but what starts as a friendly conversation always gets into a big debate/argument and since I'm just no confrontational guy to begin with, I just let people talk and keep it to myself. Just to give you guys an exemple, we've had a whole debate for some reason 3 weeks ago about this particular topic and when mom heard that I was looking forward to get vaccinated, she just busted out crying (not like a child obviously and nothing too dramatic but she was clearly crying and wasn't agreeing with my decision). Now just like I said earlier, my mom is a really emotional person even tho she tries to hide it sometimes, and when that happened I didn't really know how to react about it the whole situation. Ended up we didn't speak for a whole 2 weeks, when usually she always tries to get ahold of me on the phone or in person, because she still wasn't really feeling well about that whole situation. It's only recently I called her and told her that I'd only get vaccinated if I had no choice and not to worry about it. Since then, things just went back to normal.

Now about my dad... My dad has a complete opposite opinion about the vaccines than my mom. It might be worth mentioning that he was also feeling a bit sceptical about the vaccine at first but decided to get it anyway. Now that a new ""vaccination passport"" has recently been deployed where I'm from, meaning a bunch of activities are closing down for unvaccinated people, my dad has been urging me to get vaccinated as well. 

This whole situation going on, I've decided to get vaccinated this week and pretty much told my dad about it but obviously not my mom since I don't wanna scare her/make her anxious about the whole process. I've planned to get it done and just hide it from my mom's family side until they decide to get vaccinated as well. So here I am, torn between my mom and my dad about a decision that is pretty much for myself and myself only. If I'm being honest, I'm not entirely sure wtf I'm doing hence why I need some advice about how I could/should handle this whole mess...

TDLR; Things are closing down for unvaccinated people in my country. Emotional mom and her whole family side became antivaxxers and are begging me to not get vaccinated, dad is pressuring me to get vaccinated. Torn between 2 sides so don't know wtf I'm doing",0
1447,"Kids heartbroken about Aunt’s move Id be very grateful for some advice. 

My cousin, who is super lovely, is moving internationally with her husband. She has been a safe and loving grown up in my kids lives - and particularly for my 10 year old ever since he was born. He is very attached to her, and taking the move very personally. 

Honestly, we are very happy for her, and very supportive of this marriage. But we’ve just struggled to explain it to the kids. Their father has always had to be on the road constantly for work, and she has played the role of an extended parent over the years - attending sports games and school events (pre-covid). Over the last year when schools were shut she would see the kids every day since she lives across the street. 

We’ve talked about how it’s ok to feel sad, and that Aunty M will still be in our lives forever - but he says she is abandoning him and is heart broken. The others are sad, but handling it. He is just so so sad, I really wish I could do something to make it easier on him. 

I’d be grateful for any advice on how to help him (and her - it is hard on her too - I really am so grateful for everything she has done for us, and supportive of her new life). We do not have the financial resources to plan a trip to meet in person again for the foreseeable future so this feels very final to the children. Is there anything I can do?

Thank you very much in advance.",1
2830,"Long distance SO, with whom we've know each other for 5 months, wants to visit I am delighted but we live on two different continents, travelling so far to meet up is very expensive. 

Also i feel like it's too soon, five months isn't a lot and dont know if id feel comfortable sharing a room together yet. We've never met each other in real life and have only interacted via technology. 

I do like him and everything but i dont feel like i know-know him because there is only so much you can learn about someone without actually meeting them and sharing a living space feels like too big of a jump. 

Would asking him to slow things down a bit and see if we can meet in a more neutral setting be something too cold? 

Neutral as in see if we can visit a country together after the pandemic, each to their own expenses, that is closer to his country and have separate rooms and meet up

2161,"Losing hope I’ve been in a relationship with my fiancé for 7 years. We met when he was 18 and I was 19 and we have a solid foundation as best friends. 
We’ve both always had issues with mental health but lately my fiancé has had zero passion for life. All he wants to do is sit on the couch, drink and smoke weed. He’s always done this but now it’s the only thing he does. If he isn’t doing that he’s scrolling on his phone. And lately he’s unhappy with everything I do. I know that sounds exaggerated but it really does feel that way, he talks about wanting a certain meal, I make it and he says he’s not hungry and puts it away. I let him know I’m going to the store tomorrow and to give me a list of things he needs, I remind him three times that day and text him as I leave to go to the store so he can tell me what he wants but he doesn’t answer. When he comes home from work and I’ve shopped for myself he says I’m being selfish and not thinking of him. There have been so many instances like this, and today he told me he just doesn’t want to be around me because I’m annoying. I feel so hurt and I understand he’s dealing with depression, but it just feels like he isn’t considering me anymore I’m this relationship. How can I help him? He refuses to go to therapy and just does not seem to want to talk. Sad face.",0

To get them to wear masks, prepare them with videos, demonstrations, let them try different masks, give them reasons, reward them, and sometimes separating them from the playground is necessary to show them we’re serious

1012,"Husband Doesn’t Think Covid is a Risk for our Family My husband and I aren’t on the same page about Covid or vaccines and how best to protect our family. We are both vaccinated, though he had a fit about getting his, and his unvaccinated family members keep showing up and want to stay with us. We have two small children- a toddler and a preschooler. I think we all know the story of how people end up with different perspectives when it comes to critical thinking, media, and being influenced by the thinking of family members, etc. But it’s gotten to the point where we are very divided on this issue and I feel that he’s putting our family in risky situations by not telling his unvaccinated relatives that they can’t come visit and use our house as a home base while they go out to bars and social events, at least not while the case numbers are spiking in our community. How do we bridge this gap? I’m running out of grace and emotional resilience and it has changed how I view him.",1
1808,"Differences in the bedroom, how should I proceed? My partner (22F) and I (23M) just started getting sexual after we officially started dating, so from the beginning we both didn’t really know what the other person was into and never really considered sexual compatibility. Since sex in a relationship is pretty important to me this was new because most of my romantic partners have started off as sexual partners first so that part was never something I worried about, and almost all of them were into or somewhat into the same thing I am. If your curious, I have a breeding kink. Really anything having to do with pregnancy, pregnant women, lactation, impregnation, the whole shabang. 

For the record, I have never gotten a girl pregnant and every girl I have been with has been on birth control or had some type of contraceptive. Even my current partner is on BC. I don’t want kids and never wanna put a girl through pregnancy. Plus I ain’t got the money or time for kids either. This is purely for the kink. 

I came to find out that my current partner has a phobia of pregnancy, more specifically child birth. Which is completely okay and valid since I don’t want kids either, except for the fact it makes her wanna be super safe. Condom safe. Which if I’m being completely, painfully honest, I have never used with any of my partners. Trust me, I’m aware how unsafe that is and yes I do try to get tested before any new partners. Since it’s always been that way in a relationship or with a FWB I never really saw anything wrong with it. But that’s beside the point. I’m worried and need advice for two things in particular. 

First is the fact that I might not be sexually aroused enough or get enough stimulation from having to wear one. I know this is the typical male argument about them feeling “not the same” or “not as good” but since I never got used to one I’m genuinely worried I might not be able to perform. I wanna be better about it for her and still have her needs met.

Secondly, I’m worried that even if I do get somewhat used to it that I’m just pushing aside one of the things I really enjoy and compromising. I know that in relationship compromise is normal but with sex already being so important to me it means I have to stop a huge part of my pleasure in the bedroom. Aren’t I entitled to my sexual pleasure too? This then makes me feel selfish and I feel like what I want doesn’t matter. No, of course and for the rest of time, means no. I won’t keep asking until she concedes or make her feel bad. But does that mean I doom myself to non-satisfying sex? I could ask her one or two more times but from what we’ve talked about so far I don’t think it’ll get me far. My top priority is making her feel safe and comfortable and I don’t wanna change her, I want her to want to change if it’s best for her. I think not checking if we were sexually compatible before hand might have been not a great move but I could just be overthinking this whole thing.

Sorry for the long post, and if I sound like a pissy baby man that complains about nothing. I’m just struggling to think of what some next steps would be. 

Aside form that every other aspect of the relationship is amazing and filled with love. She’s sweet, active, creative, and exactly who I’m looking for. 

TLDR: We’re not into the same stuff and it could seriously hurt our sex lives. Not gonna make or convince her but worried it couldn’t be enough for me to enjoy.",0
2464,"I (28F) am out of a relationship with (29M) that was abusive and he has blamed me for the end even though he's created endless ultimatums. I (28F) love this guy (29M) so fucking much but I'm also at the very bottom of my emotions where I can only feel a deep loss and temptation to believe I am 100% the reason we broke up, regardless of the fact that I feel his insecurities, rigidness, and multitude of ultimatums are what really dragged me into the pit.

I wanted to take things slow from the first date but he literally ""avoided the friend zone"" as he put it and kissed me and the fireworks went and it was a 9 month insane high to insane low after that.

I told him I was trying to treat my long-tme depression and was in therapy, on the first date, which is part of why I wanted to go slow. I told him I didn't have great finances right now but was working on it slowly, I have many years of really difficult family life and relationships behind me but I wanted a healthy, loyal love in my life. I also told him I enjoyed weed when I had it in my home country but tended to overdo it because it helped my depression but had side effects.

At the time, he accept all of this and immediately deleted his Tinder in front of me (where we met) and it's like, that was it for him, he was ready to date me. It alarmed me a little at the time but over the months he was so, so loving and committed and did so many nice things for me, went out of his way so many times, he never cheated or anything, and he had his life together more than mine and I just loved him so much.

But...

He didn't like that I was in therapy and took medication nor my weed use. He felt that if I ""got healthy and changed my mindset"" and relied on him more, I wouldn't need those things to heal myself. He was adamantly against the use of ""chemicals to be happy"" despite the fact that we did occasionally drink together and he has a nicotine addiction. 

He made it an ultimatum. So I dropped those things. And for a while I was stable, then my depression worsened.

Then he made more ultimatums.

I did have some crappy friendships in my life. He encouraged me to cut them off. He was right about one of them but then also made an ultimatum about me going to DnD with a little group because he was threatened by a guy in the group who liked me and had once told me he was concerned for me because my boyfriend seemed manipulative. My boyfriend hated this guy viciously and said he was just trying to fuck me, had a history in the community of dating pretty girls and dumping them, called him terrible names etc. I became resentful because I lost DnD and I was really enjoying it and never would have allowed the guy to make a move on me, we were just friends.

My boyfriend made an ultimatum about my Instagram. It was too public and had too many followers, 2k, even though I had now put multiple pictures of us together and never posted anything inappropriate on there. He said I was addicted to social media (a little true tbh) and said if I was really committed to this relationship, I would be more low key. So it was put on private and I lost a lot of interest in it, also lost some joy and sense of freedom, and felt resentful.

He got in a habit of taking my phone and going through it which got me paranoid about him and I did the same. We broke a door and left a scar on his arm from one of these ""give me back my phone"" struggles. That was forever my fault afterward. There was never any cheating in either phone but he'd always find something that made me look terrible to him. He found out I had an empty account on IG that I occasionally used to look up people from school who I was nosy about and forever after that, he claimed I'd ""hidden this huge secret from him and broken his trust and I was shady"". I was just embarrassed about my snooping on public accounts. I wasn't talking to anyone or even looking at ex boyfriends.

We had so many fights. So many slamming doors and walking out and terrible words between eachother, but I really feel he cut the deepest with the things he said to me. He is big into fitness and criticized my body. I ended up losing a lot of weight. He claimed later he always loved my body. Then I was in the wrong because by the end he'd stopped taking care of himself as much, blamed it on me, and I had mentioned he looked different from not long ago. He held it against me for the rest of the relationship.

In fact, he had a long list, by the end, of every single thing I'd done in 9 months that made me a bad partner, unworthy of his extreme effort and all the money he spent on me, all my flaws and mistakes and shortcomings. He never forgot anything whereas I could remember the big things he'd done to me that I never felt had been resolved, especially all these ultimatums, and he never apologized and I had many times. Apologies meant nothing to him at all and he had a mantra of ""trying is lying"" in regards to whenever I'd say I really was trying my hardest in this, or trying to change something.

He wanted me to change and improve my life, which I agree I have lots of things to work on but the fastest way to make we want to rebel and feel resentment is to demand change instead of just support me kindly. He once said he was going to help ""fix"" me and I told him I never wanted to be fixed, only supported, my problems were my own but he viewed my problems, my decisions, my *anything* as ""ours"". 

I sank into a depression and started just retreating into my phone for hours of scrolling, often obsessively reading on Reddit about other people with my same issues and how they fixed it. He hated this and felt I was ignoring him and boring. I just felt tired. I gave him all my free time and never went out anymore unless he was there. Nothing felt like enough. His criticisms just kept coming and I wasn't ""changing"" fast enough and was ""ruining his life"".

One time I got fed up during an argument and was going to leave, as I had many times, and he stole my phone and kept it away from me physically. I got so angry I slapped him across the face. He grabbed my face in return and shook me. From then on I was now also ""physically abusive"" and I do feel guilty about my temper and slapping him. I just felt powerless in the moment and so angry.

He dumped me a few days ago. Very coldly. It was like he was a stranger. Usually we always loved eachother despite our arguments but now he refused to say it back. I'd cried so much in this relationship but my tears never touched him and he told me they never would. 

He ""officially dumped me"" because I ""picked weed over him"" but for me it was about the stress I was feeling and my being tired of ultimatums and having no freedom for my own choices. I didn't want to give up the last little thing that brought me some relief, even if it was a ""drug"". And I didn't even have it in this country. 

He called me and very calmly told me I had destroyed the relationship and never worked hard enough or truly committed and I had a lot of issues and no one was ever going to accept them or put in the effort he did for me. That I refused to change and it was killing the relationship.

I know he did love me. He was not evil. He did do a great deal for me but quite a lot of it was not things I asked for. And there were quite a lot of things I did ask for but never got. He said there was nothing about him that needed to change for the relationship because he wasn't doing the things harming the relationship, I was. I was sleeping too much. I was on my phone too much. I didn't clean up behind myself enough or leave my shoes properly by the door. I didn't have a solid daily routine. I was ""addicted"" to substances instead of improving my life. Nevermind that when he met me, I was in therapy and on proper medication, working on things. To him, my depression was an excuse. 

His last text to me was him saying some insult about my dead mom and her drug use and that my problems are ""in my genes"". 

I'm not even sure why I wrote all this here. Maybe for validation or just because I'm very sad. I feel stuck between feeling like I lost a man that a ""normal woman"" would dream to have because she wouldn't have all these problems and he'd never get as upset with her. That I really pushed him to his limits and exhausted his patience with me, as he said. Or that maybe I just spent 9 months with a very unconscious uptight abusive person who love bombed me at the beginning.

I just don't know anything right now. I feel numb and lost.",0
805,"My toddler (2.5M) won’t sleep in his bed I’m so tired, I love my son to death but his constant waking up to move to my bed is killing me. I have depression/anxiety/PTSD which already makes it extremely difficult to sleep and Idk what to do, I put him in bed when he falls asleep or right when he’s about to and he’ll stay asleep til about 3/4 am then he starts crying, idk if it’s a bad dream (happens every night so idk if it could be a dream every time) or growing pains etc. he has a toddler bed in my room on the other side and he picked it out(literally dragged the box to me in the store with his baby strength lol) so I thought that would help since it’s paw patrol themed(one of his fave shows) it did at first but now he’s back to wanting to only sleep by me. I move him back after he goes back down once I’m sure he’s actually asleep and by the morning he’s back in my bed kicking and slapping and rolling around making himself comfortable and radiating heat (no, he’s not sick) making it uncomfortable and nearly impossible for me to fall asleep. Please any advice would help. 

Also he does have his own room but the crying was worse and yes I’ve tried the cry it out method and this kid will go for hours and I can’t keep trying it Bc I live with family and they get passive aggressive toward/yell at me for disturbing them. Overall he’s a very independent character but this nighttime clinging is only cute for so long.

2665,"LDR couples that closed the distance, how did you all cope with moving far from your family? I(28f) have been with my boyfriend (29m) for about 2 years. We met in college, fell in love, graduated. I got a job at our university and he got into grad school at a bomb ass medical school in a different city. We’ve been doing long distance for about 4 months and we still feel very much in love and we make effort into making date night fun and nightly calls as connected as we can.

Of course we had the LDR talk when he received his acceptance letter and since he’s going to be in school for the next 3 years, it made sense that I would move where he is and join him but financially, I would need a job there in order to make it. 

I have a pretty promising interview next week so we started talking about logistics and our life together once I get there. I want to marry this man, he’s my soulmate and balances me perfectly and enhances my life in the best way.

BUT! My family… we’re all close and he knows this. We don’t see that city as a permanent placement but we will be there for quite a while while he’s in school and getting licensed. My parents like him fine and they said that they’d have no problem with him becoming family someday. But they’ve been saying thing here and there that is putting some guilt on me. Stuff like “I remember when you were a kid, you used to say you’d build a house behind our house so that we’d always stay together.” or “&lt;destination&gt;… that’s 12 hours away. That’s awful far..” 

I’ve already made the decision to go with him. But I know that I will miss being so close to my family. 12 hours isn’t bad but it’s not a day trip and flights require some planning. 

LDR couples, how did you cope being far from family? What worked and made things easier to adjust? How did you handle travel to visit families? Just any advice is welcome!

TL;DR: might be moving 12 hours away from my family soon. I’m close to my family. They support me but i can tell the distance bothers them and I know I will get emotional. LDR couples, how did you cope being far away from family? What worked and made things easier?",0
821,"My 5 year old niece is being verbally and emotionally abused by my sister and mom Possible trigger warning.

I don't know what to do. My husband and I decided to move in because we moved states to save up for own place. I've been reading several  books and watching countless videos on gentle  and empathizing with kids and the way my niece is being treated is terrifying to me. 

She is 5 in December, and my mother (her grandma) is constantly telling her the shows she watch are stupid and horrible and makes constant racist and homophobic remarks, including telling random strangers and homeless people to kill themselves and that she'll gut them and laugh. When she's just being a kid, laughing and running around, not breaking or anything, she gets yelled at for being too much. My mother constantly tells her she's going to kill herself or move and never come back and screams at the top of her lungs.

If she makes a mess that's easily cleaned up in 5 minutes, like water on the counter or paper on the floor, her mother and grandma get so rageful. Just ten minutes ago she accidentally spilled water on the counter and her mom starts yelling at how useless she is and that it's her fault she wants to die and saying she's a bitch and etc and threatens to disappear as well. My sister acts like her child is an adult with a fully developed brain and emotional regulation and gets angry when she doesn't act like it. She snaps at her immediately for everything.

My mother never speaks about anything positive, it's always about how horrible the world is, how horrible the house is, how horrible food is, and this child gets told by everyone that she's a big reason they're miserable. 

It terrifies me because I'm recognizing what I grew up with. I've been here for a month and I'm seeing the guilt. I was watching her while they were at work and she spilled a glass of water on our tile floor and she immediately began bawling like I was going to yell at her. I just smiled and told her we clean up our messes, so had her grab a towel and wipe it up. 

Whenever I see her with big emotions and screaming and hyperventilating, I remind her to take deep breaths and that it's okay to feel like that, though it isn't okay to hurt people. 

I love my family. At this point I'm moving out with my husband asap because I didn't realize how intense living at home was again after being away for so long and doing work. I don't want to step on toes, though I've tried talking to her mom about how she's only a toddler and we have to BE what we expect them to be, e.g. handling our emotions so she learns to regulate her own. It's all been brushed off. 

She doesn't do anything crazy. She makes messes like a toddler, sometimes bumps into us, doesn't break stuff, and is loud and playful like a toddler. She really isn't a bad kid besides the hitting which I think is from seeing her mom and grandma punch walls and furniture. 

It's really not my place to say or do anything but I am afraid for her. The things they say to her would haunt me as an adult, much less a child who isn't developed. I don't know what to do.",1
1315,"Starting to resent my stepchildren and feeling really guilty about it Just need to vent! Thank you for reading! 

So I have two stepchildren (Cindy 6f and Brandon 11m). They are like normal children, talk a lot, play rough, are friends one second and fighting the next, you know how it is.

I also have a 9mo old son with my husband. Conceived just before the pandemic hit us. 

Before having my baby I always enjoyed having the kids over. We had them most weekends and all vacations (all!). I always tried to make food they liked, to watch movies with them, do dance “battles” with music they liked etc etc. Just overall trying to make them have a good time when they were with us. The oldest (Brandon) is kind of a know-it-all and Cindy is very good at manuipulating her way to get what she wants. I found this a little problematic before but I tried to work with them through these issues sometimes and help them to become more humble and honest. 

Then I got pregnant and pandemic hit. We were struggling financially a lot because of the pandemic and as I got bigger and closer to due date I couldn’t work as before. It resulted in my husband having to work more and I had to stay with the baby and fix the house while also handling the two stepchildren all by myself weeks at a time. 

Because of this new situation I don’t have the same amount of energy as before and taking care of my stepchildren has become a nightmare. I have a baby to take care of too and it seems like my stepchildren are plotting against me (they aren’t, I know it’s my own perception but it’s getting really hard). 

Example: we were travelling for a vacation with everyone and it was just survival for me. We rented an apartment in a house with a pool and the kids loved it. I was making sure baby was okay and that everyone got to eat properly etc while not having one single moment for myself. My husband really wants to give his children a proper vacation every summer and I agree with him but it’s just getting too hard. Husband is helping and doing most of the driving and lifting and planning but it’s just not easy. 

In the morning we had to leave we were going to drive early from the house we were staying in. Cindy asks us while we are packing the last stuff if she can have breakfast. We say we will buy sandwiches and some cake at the bakery and eat it in the car (the bakery was literally 1 minute from the house we were staying at and we had 3 minutes of packing left). She says okay. When we are ready to leave we can’t find her and then when I go down to the first floor where the women we rented from lives, I see Cindy sitting by the table in the ladies house and having juice and eating toast. Very confused I ask what’s going on and the land-lady tells us that Cindy came down and said she was dying of hunger and that her tummy was hurting and asked for food. She did this 1 minute after we told her we would buy her sandwiches and cake for the trip. At no movement did she tell me she was dying of hunger or that her stomach was hurting. 

Normally I would handle a situation like this but this time I didn’t say anything and just told Cindy we had to leave. I was so hurt and angry at her and I felt this the whole car ride where she btw didn’t finish the sandwich we bought her (her favourite). I didn’t say anything and just kept silent so I wouldn’t explode. I know it’s just kids and I want to be this awesome stepmother but right now I just feel resentment towards the kids. I give everything I have (money, energy, sanity) to make them happy and they just lie and manipulate and make me look bad to other people, insinuating I don’t feed them, while what I did to make this vacation enjoyable for them was taking all the last energy (and money) I had.

I don’t know what to do. It’s not their fault and I do a good job hiding my feelings but inside i am losing my love for them. 

We don’t have enough money for therapy and my husband is already working a lot so I can’t ask him to take over. 

I don’t know what I want to say with this post but if you have read so far I thank you!!",1

2185,"Am I overthinking? (I deal with ocd &amp; anxiety just as a heads up) So my fiancé  and I have been together for almost 4 years. We’re getting married soon &amp;amp; I love him very much. This year has been ALOT. I had a mental break back in April and it seems my mental health has suffered since then, I’m better but still not where I would like to be. My fiancé has been so patient as I am working through childhood traumas and just my mental health in general.

Now to get to the question, my fiancé and I was discussing this guy we know and my fiancé is aware that I’ve said I thought the guy was attractive so when I was talking to him I said “you remember the guy, that I thought was cute?” And. he responded with “oh yeah, he was a good looking guy”. Then a couple days ago, I was telling him about one of my clients, I work with individuals with developmental disabilities and one of my clients is very flirtatious in a cute way and she’s hit on one of my coworkers husbands before so I jokingly told him “gotta be careful she might try to take you from me” and he jokingly said “babe, just tell her I’m gay”. That caused me to overthink and think the worst. Then last night we were watching Tik Tok &amp; there was a girl who was packing some stuff (it was an organization video) and he said “what is she doing?, like it’s already full, girl” and you can imagine, I started overthinking like crazy. 

Just for background, my mom’s last marriage ended because of her husbands homosexual past, which is something she’s went into great detail with me about so I think that’s a fear of mine. 

I’ve been open and honest with my fiancé and he’s reassured me that he is NOT gay and only desires and wants me. He’s been patient but this morning I was really overthinking and he was like “I’m patient because I understand you’re going through something but this has got to stop, you’re questioning my manhood &amp; its hard”. 

I will say, my fiancé &amp; I have no problems in the sexual department. I’ve been holding out as I want to wait to marriage for intercourse; however, when we do engage in sexual activities he almost always initiates it. He’s always touching my boobs (has to have a handful before he sleeps lol), and my butt. &amp; last year for his birthday I purchased some lingerie but I ended up not wearing it &amp; he was annoyed that I didn’t wear it so there’s that. 

I talked to my therapist about it &amp; she said “I don’t want to say thus because I don’t want to make you more anxious but I mean I could see why you asked him if he was gay or not” &amp; that made me overthink even more lol

I was raised in an authoritative household. I was raised to both love, respect and fear my father. We had a close relationship and we are close to this day. My father comes from a time where a father's job was to teach his son how to be a man, and that meant a lot of tough love. But he also rejected the coldness that he was shown from his father, and he was open and loving to me as well. I was spanked from time to time. I definitely loved my father but I knew to not misbehave or do the wrong thing because it would result in scolding, or if I really messed up, a spanking. I grew up to be a disciplined man with good values and I am successful in life. However, I have had some depression throughout my life and I have never been very outspoken and I was not very confident as a child. These are some of the downfalls of authoritative . 

&amp;#x200B;

When I raise my children, I want them to be confident in themselves and comfortable with sharing their thoughts and feelings with me, but I also want them to be disciplined, obedient and have respect for authority. I want them to use sir and ma'am when they speak to adults. I feel that I definitely lean much more authoritative in the  style I want to use, but with a small amount of authoritarian  style mixed in. I want my kids to be able to share their feelings with me and feel emotion without worry, but they should know that their actions can result in punishment and sometimes in spanking when their actions and behavior are severely in the wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, I'm a new parent. My wife and I are 26 and 25 years old. We think we have a style of  that we want to go with and abide by, but we just don't know how to implement and practice those ideals. If you know of books, blogs, etc. that you think would help us on our journey as new parents, I'd love if you'd share. And if you disagree with me, I am open to your opinion as well. I am as green as it gets when it comes to  and I have a lot to learn and I am open to new ideas and ways of thinking.",1
91,"Toddler hitting, pinching and throwing all of a sudden. Daughter is 26 months old, and we are a split household for the next few months as we transition through a relocation. 

This week, my daughters behaviour went from excellent to poor. I am thinking she is acting out partly because she is upset that mommy is gone, and FaceTime can only do so much. She is also entering the terrible 2 phase, and we knew the honeymoon was gong to end at some point.

Last night, she threw her milk, and food and made a GIANT mess everywhere with her food. She normally listens when we tell her to not throw things or most things she understands, which is again most things, but not last night. She heard me, she just did not care.

Then when I went to clean it up, she slapped me, hit me, and kicked me from her high chair. She had this almost angry look that I haven't seen on her before. Head down, eyes just watching me. I had to step away and take a breathe to get my frustration under control and formulated a new plan. I got her into bath, and the rest of the evening was ok, she woke up happy this morning. This wasn't throwing food because it seemed like a fun thing to do, and I had to move her to an entirely different activity to get her refocused. Ended up feeding her while snuggling and watching some Bluey, but that isn't a normal routine thing and routines are really critical for my own mental health, let alone hers.

What are good tactics and tips to help with curbing the behaviour, while also trying to recognize her big very real feelings. I feel like the easy ride we have had to date with this kid has left my tool box very lacking.

This has been building up for a few weeks. My concern is that if I don't address this now, it will snow ball into more behaviour issues. Plus, it hurts with her little dagger claws. The very limited time I have with my wife, I want her spending with my daughter. Same with FaceTime. This isn't an issue I can easily bring up to her, where she would be able to help. All it would do is bring more guilt and stress to her plate and that helps nobody. For now, I am alone on this problem.

Help! I have absolutely no idea what I am doing, and I am failing hard here.",1
3100,"Girlfriend Cheated/Lied- How to breakup? Hi,

My girlfriend[F23] and I [M23] been dating about 3 months.

Long story short she has deceived me in the past/tried to hide things/Deleting conversations and Snapchat’s. I tried to calmly and non accusingly talk to her about this before and how it made me feel but apparently she didn’t get the message. 

I like to think I am a very forgiving person but trust is extremely important to me.

Given that my trust for her was starting to diminish due to this I have been thinking about whether I should break up with her for about a week or two. So today I decided to check her phone while she was in the bathroom. I know its not right but I just couldn’t help following my intuition that something wasn’t right. All I did was check her recent texts messages and found that she had lied to me on two separate occasions about hanging with 2 other guys behind my back, both happen within the last week or two. 

The first one she apparently had drove to another’s guys house and brought coffee to him, who we have talked about in the past and was the guy who took her virginity, and was her “best friend” before we were together. My GF previously told me there was no longer anything sexual between the two and that he now had a girlfriend(which I confirmed because this boy posts her on insta quite a bit). She lied about this occasion and said she was going to a girlfriends house that day.

The second one was another guy who she has told me tried to talk to her before, she told me she was going to hangout with cousins, in reality she drove to pick him up and then hung out with him. The next day he texts her wanting to hangout again but she said “sorry I got caught up.”

Lying about hanging with another guy who I have never ever met I consider cheating or damn close to it.

So This was basically the last straw for me and I have already pretty much decided I want to breakup with her. 

I wish her the best but I’m just not the man who is willing to put up with lying about such things.

My question is, when I breakup with her do I tell her that I went thru her phone and this was the final straw that made me want to call it quits or should I just say that I no longer want to be in a relationship / am not happy and leave it at that? Part of me wants to tell her so she doesn’t try to play dumb and pretend like she had no idea why I’m doing it but I’m just not sure.

TLDR: Girlfriend lied about hanging out 2 different guys on 2 occasions, only found out because I went thru her phone. Breakup with vague reason or tell her that I went thru her phone?

Any replies are welcome and appreciated 

Thank you.",0
2915,"Boyfriend loving his family way too much or am i just toxic? I don’t really know if this is the right place to Vent out my feelings like this but i’m struggling right now and need advice. 
(Also sorry for my english, it’s not my native language)

So me (20F)and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for a year and 2 months. And we’re currently renting an apartment together where we’ve lived in for 7months. 
I love my boyfriend i really do! He’s an amazing person, gets excited for me and encourages me to become a better self while also loving and caring for his family. Speaking of family:

1. he loves his family a LOT, Before we moved in together he would spend every friday with his family and be unsure if he would spend the night or not, but he always ended up being there the whole weekend , and sometimes even more since he loves it there. He has a mom, dad and a sister that loves him a lot

I grew up in a toxic household with mental and physical abuse, we don’t give hugs and stuff in my family and my mom rarely does something when we come for a visit. 
But his family is basically perfect, i’ve only seen a family like that in movies! Board games, sitting in the living room together watching something fun on tv and laughing, eating candy and snacks together and delicious homemade dinners!! Every.Single.Weekend. 

So here’s whats bothering me:

I feel like my boyfriend doesn’t want to be with me and my family, It feels like he always thinks about his family above all. I mean, Of course! It’s his family but we live together and there’s small things he does that bother me tbh.. 
Whenever we have something to share with others he always want to do it with his family, we bought mystery bags from a grocery store to save a wasted meal, and we got 4 different breads. And i said we could share it with someone and he insisted that we needed to share with his family! (They’re well off while my mom struggle with money) 
We were going to eat out one day and he said he rather be with his family than eat out with me

Whenever he has piano lessons he takes the bus to his family and eats there and after the piano lessons he usually takes the last bus home (which is around midnight, and his piano lessons are from 6:30-7:30pm) 
Whenever he’s at his familys house just in general he comes home around midnight, after leaving straight after school
He calls his mom or vice versa every night, even though it’s just a 20min drive to them so they don’t live far away..
He even said one time that if his mother dies he will kill himself..
He wants to spend every holiday with his own family so we usually split up for those times.. unless i celebrate with them like i did on New Years Eve..
There’s times when we have been invited to something at my familys house, and he says he wants to see his family before returning home.. 
it stresses me out, it feels like i’m not prioritized..at all.. 
There’s times i feel guilty for us being with my family.. instead of his..

Trust me, i’ve told him about it, and he usually gets defensive. Saying that he’s not as much with his family as he used to (and it’s true) but i feel as if it was too extremely before? And now it’s just extreme. And he doesnt see the problem..He never tells me when he’s coming home, he just says
 «I don’t know» and then gets upset or defensive when i say i want to know when he gets home. Telling me stuff like «I don’t know when i’m coming home! If it’s really cozy i want to be there longer! I don’t want to say i’m coming home around 7pm when i can’t even promise that»

Also he doesnt really invite me when he leaves, i usually invite myself.. and i feel really guilty for doing so.. 
They went on a trip for 6days and His sisters boyfriend were invited and not me, and he didn’t do anything about it.. didnt question it or anything.. i felt really upset and left out..he could at least ask his mom why her boyfriend was invited but not me? 

Or am i just toxic? Wanting him to spend too much time with me?",0

378,"Letting my ex move with DS6 This is a bit long, but I want to put this out there. If there are any parents that are trying to navigate a situation similar to this, please feel free to message me. I want to support others and hear your voice.

I do not have any sort of drug related problem. I have a stable home life for my children. I have a good and healthy relationship with my husband. We both work full-time. I do not have a criminal record. I have custody of my other 2 children and have been raising my stepdaughter for the last 4.5 years. And through all of this, I made one of the hardest decisions any parent could have to make: I agreed to let my son move with his father full time to another state.

\*\*Back story for context: My ex and I do not mesh well together in terms of a relationship. But since we broke up year ago, DS6 has always come first. I also have a DS9 (special needs) that becomes violent towards others and emotionally is a lot younger than his physical age. He targets his younger brother often. His younger brother also pesters him, which can cause a violent outburst as well. Both of my sons do better when they are not together all of the time. I do not live in the best school district. I am currently in the process of getting my DS9 into an alternative school for his disabilities. He goes to a different school at this time, but it is not providing the correct help he needs so alternative options are being sought out. DS6 currently lives in the much better one. So I told my ex that I feel the better option would be for him to take DS6 during the week and I will get him on weekends. This gives him the chance to get a better education and also be in a more stable environment away from his brother.\*\*

Recently, my ex has been given an opportunity to better his current situation. He has the chance to move across the country, get into a forever home, and make more money than he does currently. His father is also in his 70s and living with him. His father's health is starting slowly to decline. Both my ex and his father would not go because they do not want to leave DS6.

My ex's sister suggested they all move out there. She has always cared for their father and he needs her a lot right now. DS6 and his grandfather are the best of friends. That little boy is constantly with his grandfather and visa versa. My ex brought it up to me and we had a long discussion. After a couple of days, I decided it was the best decision for my child. He has a lot more support from my ex's family. This is a better chance for him. The education system is a lot better in the new place than this state. The teacher to student ratio is a lot better also. They will be moving to a more laid back area that has a HUGE decrease in crime and a higher sense of community.

I personally do not have a ton of support here as I am a foster care alumni. I would be leaving the state too, but I can't just yet. I have to wait a few years. This is due to my SD12 being established with a ton of support here with her family (both my in-laws and her mother's parents/brother, her mother previously moved out of state). I am not close-knit with my in-laws. (I try to keep my interactions with them to a somewhat minimal level. Holidays, birthdays, and a few outings during the summer are the only times I really have to engage longer periods of in-person time with them. They have spoken on things that I do not agree with and they are very vocal on their political views, which I am not. I hardly discuss politics. They have not made the best choices with their words around my SD12 regarding me, my own children, and others, but that is something I am unable to control. And it has slowed down over time. I do my best to keep things civil and positive. Things have gotten better over the last year or two, but I still have my reservations. Overall, they are good-hearted people and mean well. They are older, so some of their opinions do stem from a different world than the one we live in. At the end of the day, they are relatively supportive of my husband and I in many of our choices.) My husband and I have a DD2 together.

I was brought up in a dysfunctional home without a lot of love and about the same level of support. It was just me, my mother, and my great-grandmother (whom I saw about 3-4 times a month on average - some weeks more than others). The only real love I ever really experienced as a child was my grandmother during those early years. I had a shit education and real no fighting chance to become something good. I was put into foster care as a teen and that is where I learned how accept love from others and what a family was really. If I had not been put into a better situation and given the chance at life like that, I know I would have been a totally different and shitty person. And this is what I want to give my son. I want him to know that I did the best I could, with the cards I have been dealt.

Taking all of this into consideration, I made the choice that I feel is best for my child. This decision was not made lightly. It brought a lot of guilt and anger. My head was screaming at me that I was a failure and I was abandoning my child. My heart was slapping my brain, telling it to shut the fuck up and I was doing everything I could to give my child the best possible future. I am still dealing with this. It is heavily weighing on my mind as I have less than 4 months left with my child within 20 minutes from me. I know it is going to get harder, but this is not about my needs at the end of it.

If there is anyone out there that has experienced this as well, please shoot me a message. I would love advice on how to deal with these feelings and the like. If anyone is considering this route, please feel free to message me.",1
3062,"Libido discrepancy - one-sided open relationship? (Me: 22M, GF: 22F) Hello,

I'm in a what we both (me m22 and her f22) consider a long term relationship. We've been together for about 2.5 years and we are both very happy. It's just that we both have very different needs in bed. At first we had lots of sex (I suppose that's normal) and then gradually her sexual needs declined - mine not. She told me she only needs sex like once a moth, I on the contrary are pretty much always in the mood. It seemed to me that it is my problem and I didn't want to push her into having sex with me if she is not in the mood. So when she says that she is not in the mood I accept that. Therefore I often self-release the pressure, but the consequence is not at all wanting less sex. 

I like to try new things in bed and would describe myself rather adventerious, my girlfriend is more conservative. It feels like a hole I can't fill - surely there are times I've a lot of work to do and it's not as consuming but the tendency is the hole growing bigger. I observed myself looking at other girls and...yes, wanting sex with them...I felt very guilty and as if I was cheating by even thinking such a thing, but lately I read(/watched videos) about polyamory, open relationships and so on. This got me thinking.

But what now? We talked earlier in our relationship about open relationships (just casually) and she made clear she doesn't feel the urge to be with other men. I told her the same but a small voice whispered even then to me, that this is not really what I was feeling. The problem was - I didn't even know how I really felt. I know I wouldn't like at all if she was having sex with other men. Is it still a good idea to propose a one-sided open relationship? In my head I say she might even be releaved (not having to be the only one fulfilling my sexual needs), but I don't know if it's just a way to try to legitimate it. 

I really love her and I'm full of fear. There are two main reasons why: (1) I fear that talking about it will negatively influence our relationship and even if she is down for it that whats then to come has a negative influence on our relationship. (2) I fear if we do not talk about it, that the hole will consume me and we both become unhappy because there's something invisible between us we don't face but both can feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Has someone similar experiences? Advises?

Wish you all the best.

2239,"Insecurities or Hi, 

History: 

In 2017, my current gf dated a guy and they broke up after 8 months (it was her first bf ever and they broke up because she thinks that he cheated). Shortly after, the guy moved on with a new girlfriend while my gf remained single until she met me. Fast forward, we started to date at the beginning of 2019 so two years after her breakup. The first six months were all fun and joy until I accidentally saw her stalking her ex on Facebook on NewYear's Eve. It appeared that she does it every day or every other day that made him on the top on her search list always (even more frequent than looking at my profile). After sometimes, I told her how I felt and she stopped. She told me that she did it unconsciously because she has been doing it for the past two years and didn't put much thought into it. She also reassured me that she has no feeling left for him but it was more like her   
""daily routine"" and it will take her sometimes to break that habit loop. Later I found out that she stalked him on Instagram with a fake account as well and that has not stopped since then. I told her again and she deleted the account. Fast forward one and a half years later, I found her looking at the ex's new girlfriend profile on Facebook during Valentine week and I was furios. Just like the previous times, she brushed it off and said she was just curious and nothing else. Ever since then, I have been very insecure and possessive. I check her phone to see what she is up to and constantly comparing myself to her ex. Although she stopped doing it altogether now, there's still this unease feeling in my subconscious mind that really doubts her love. I constantly bring up what she did in the past and our relationship keeps going downhill because of that. We have been dating for two years now and I love her very much. However, I also have this fear that she doesn't love me as much as her ex. I am aware that stalking your ex is normal but to do it so consistently after two years even when you have a new bf really gets me to wonder. Please advise.",0

2555,"Long term relationship basically ruined hi everyone. recently and rather suddenly, my girlfriend (20f) of well over 2 years informed me she wasn’t happy in our relationship anymore. also, i’m (21m). i am requesting help handling this and going from here. 

history:
our relationship has been better than i could’ve ever imagined since it began in summer 2019. due to unforeseen circumstances on her end, she ended up having no other options but to move in with me early that august, making the relationship “official.”

since then, its been amazing. we’ve had no trust issues or typical relationship drama of people in their early 20s. we do just about everything together, and its always so happy and healthy between us. 

we ended up getting our own place last april (my best friend and i had a house before and she moved in) and it has yet again been nothing short of perfect. we scored the perfect house (rental. very very good price for an insanely nice house. i couldn’t ask for a better house in a more perfect location. i am very thankful). we’ve made many “lifelong” purchases then when we moved in. huge comfy sectional couch, 75 inch tv, nice dining room table, and so much more. just figuring that at that point it was gonna be a forever thing. 

problem:
until last october, we were always pretty well off financially. this all went downhill when i reached a point of having to quit my job.

i’ve struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for a few years up until this point, and it had finally reached a point of really seriously impacting my life negatively. i worked as a pizza delivery driver, and by last september, i was unable to go to work without getting there and having a panic attack. this had resulted in me being sent home, even hospitalized a couple times. despite this, i still tried my hardest to be able to work, but it was just not working. (also, i needed some time off as-at the time- i could afford to. i had been working two jobs for a long time going into the summer, and hadn’t been taking nearly any time for myself or my mental health.”

my plan was to quit this job anyway, it had gotten  bad, and i had better financial opportunities elsewhere. i planned to take about 2-3 weeks for myself before getting another job. unfortunately, this anxiety continued to spiral and by november i was struggling to even walk into the grocery store without having a panic attack and feeling i was going to pass out. 

throughout the winter, i worked hard, with the help of my girlfriend, on getting right. i saw a therapist, took medication, and finally got an income. i became a doordash driver, since it allowed me to be able to choose my schedule at that time. this was important because if i had a panic attack, i could stop my work that day, and wouldn’t be fired for having to leave early. at first i started out slow, just taking the most local deliveries. my girlfriend would even come with me because i would get so anxious by myself. we just enjoyed the time together. 

as 2021 progressed, i continued to doordash. making more money and having it as my full time job. this was fine, money wasn’t great but i was trying to do my part. still, i needed a real, reliable job. by early june, the stress of me not making a lot of money was taking a toll on my girlfriend, and it felt terrible. i just wanted a real job to do my part and then some so my girlfriend had nothing to worry about, like she did for so long before. so she told me i need a real job by the end of june. i agreed, and i filled out a dozen applications right away. a couple places informed me i wouldn’t be hired, because of qualifications etc. but i managed to score a couple interviews. unfortunately, i didn’t get the job at any of these places (fedex, school bus company)

this definitely broke my spirits a bit but i continued to door dash and make money. finally in mid august, still not having a real job, but still looking. i’ve filled out many more applications (grocery stores, post offices, factories, delivery jobs.) but i just couldn’t get one. even the local grocery store wouldn’t call me back. 

my girlfriend told me that she was looking for her own place but we would remain in a relationship. she explained how we just need some time living separately to get our stuff together mentally etc. but the relationship was still great and we were both happy, just had some personal struggles.

now, september is here, and even though last week my girlfriend made it clear to me she wants this to be a forever thing, yesterday she informed me she is no longer happy and the relationship has basically reached its end. somehow this changed so drastically in less than a week’s time. 

she had told me that my time at our house has come to an end, and i’ve got to go. (probably back to my mom’s house, unfortunately).

she says she just isn’t happy in the relationship anymore. i just don’t understand and feel absolutely terrible. she has been happy for so long, its so sudden. we both thought of this as a forever thing, especially given that we are both working adults, not in school, with our own house for awhile now.

yes i know i have had some terrible personal struggles and mental health issues, but i haven’t just mailed it in and said i don’t care. i just want more than anything to land an actual job that isn’t door dash, i just haven’t had any luck somehow, even though i apply at places with now hiring signs. 

i just want to give her the world. i care about her happiness, health and safety more than anything. she is an amazing girlfriend and person, and has done more for me than anyone could’ve ever asked or imagined.

i feel absolutely terrible about this. it feels like i’ve just ruined the best thing that has ever happened in my life. thrown away my future and hurt such a sweet girl. i could’ve never imagined a future without us together. its just tearing me apart to the point of being physically ill. we have so many great memories and share just about everything. i just don’t even know what to do. i have no idea. where do i go from here? what do i do?",0
612,"Newborn life is not for me so far My child will be one month old tomorrow, and it has been a hell of a ride. The sad part is, she’s what people would consider easy for a baby! But that’s also the annoying part, I feel bad for complaining because so many other moms tell me I’m lucky. 

She is breastfed, and she wants to sit on my breast constantly. She wants to comfort feed all the time, and won’t take a pacifier as a substitute (working on it everyday, but probably won’t happen for a while). She only wants to nap in my arms right now, and any time I try to set her down she immediately wakes up. I’ve tried setting her in several different places. So basically, I have to have the baby in my arms 24/7 for her to sleep. Seems like a dream to some, but it’s truly been hard to “enjoy these moments” when I can’t even get a shower in without hearing her scream in her dad’s arms. I seriously want to go back to work early because I don’t think I can do this for 12 weeks. I’ve also thought about not breastfeeding, but she can’t comfort feed on a bottle since she won’t take a pacifier. 

My parents are dealing with Covid, so this week has been extra rough because I can’t see them. I’m being evaluated for PPD next week because I’ve also felt so many of the symptoms. Time is flying by but also passing SO slow. I just want to get through this phase of intense attachment.

337,"Mediation/Court (UK) Hi all,

Firstly sorry if this is the wrong sub!

I'm a father, of one child, who is four year old. Communicating with my child's mother is unbearable. I have him on average 2 nights a week, I have seen him every single week of his life without fail since he was born, I was at the birth (we weren't together then)

She makes threats of taking me to court, if I don't do what she wants, ie looking after my son on the same specific day each week, despite knowing my days off are staggered. I'm always polite and respectful when talking but I get a barage of lies about how she makes my life easy and ""allows"" me to work, how she has him 365 days a year and I do nothing, which is completely false.

I pay child support every week and have done every week his whole life. Even in times where I wasn't working I continued paying the amount based on my full time wage, because I'm scared to tell her I can't afford it as she will kick off.

There is no compromise, or movement on her side, you either find a way to help her with her demands or get threatened, I have been suppressing my true opinions and compromising myself for far to long, to keep the peace, but its at the point where I'm breaking down, having panic attacks, being frozen and not knowing what to say etc

My son never wants to go home, says he doesn't love his mum, how she scares him, all of his statements are unpromted! ""My mum tries to control my brain"" it all makes sense, she is a narcissist  and I understood exactly how he feels being around her. I need help please.

1. Do I need to inform my child's mother I'm initiating mediation, or can I just do it?

2. If she stops me seeing him, which she has done in the past, how long does it take until I can see him via the courts.  As I can't bear to not see him for months on end knowing how unhappy he is with his mum.

Any advice? Practical advice too, as I don't even trust going into her house as she starts trouble, or makes things hostile.

I'm on the birth certificate

1275,"Asking daycare teachers how my son is doing, how often is too much? This is only his 2nd week, and he had half day half of last week. So today is 3rd day he’s staying there full time. 

He’s 14m and very attached to me, still cries hysterically when I drop him off. 

The daycare teacher says I can contact them anytime to see how he’s doing. I have the phone number of the primary teacher, and the day he stayed full time for the first time, she sent me multiple photos and videos, which I really appreciated. The class usually has 5 kids. I know the teachers are great. But I’m always anxious about how he’s doing. 

How often is too often to text them and ask how he’s doing? Does your daycare use an app for parents?m",1
2450,"I am 24(M). I lied to my gf (24F) about something cheap and petty and she forgave me. I want to win her trust back and prove that she made the right decision. What should I do? I am an insecure person. I lied to her when we met for the first time that I had a particular car which her ex also had. And I continued this lie till last week( total 2.5 years). I used to convince myself by saying since you’re not misleading her and she knows everything about you and it was my silly insecurity and nothing related to her. I told her and she was broken because it took me 2.5 years to confront this and now she is having a hard time trusting me. I was a douche, insecure and I did a petty thing. I never mislead her, she is aware about me and everything about my family, but it’s still hard to digest as she is now wondering what else I can lie about. The truth is nothing else I have lied about but I understand where she is coming from. I know I made a very cheap mistake and she is a sweetheart for still being with me and putting her faith once again. But I want to make it right and show her that I have changed and it was a one time thing and won’t happen in future. I did it out of my insecurity and when we mer she was not over her ex then so I got more insecure and I just did it. Then it was super hard for me to confront till now. What’s done is done, it was bad. I am not gonna do it again. But how do I make her realize this so she trust me again and realize that she made the right decision of giving us another shot.

1454,"What is best for a child? Hopefully this is the right subreddit to share in, as I feel it has individuals on both sides of the scenario, and I prefer to hear different perspectives. My child is four, their father was on and off with involvement in the beginning, then completely absent for two full years of our child’s life(this stretch was recent). After politely requesting he sign his rights away so our child could be adopted by my husband who has raised them as his own, my child’s father said no and that he would file for visitation/custody but ‘had to jump through hoops’. He did not ever end up filing, so months later I arranged a supervised visit, and we continued weekly visits for a few months. He has since completely fallen off of the face of the earth again, and cut all contact without reason or explanation. I am concerned about our child’s confusion with the situation. In my state, a parent’s rights can be terminated without their consent if they have not made contact or paid any support after one year. In this scenario my husband could adopt our child. I am unsure if this route would be more damaging to our child than letting their father walk in and out. Does anyone have any thoughts to share? I would like to create as healthy of a childhood as possible.",1
3108,"Sexual text with no actual physical ending? I feel very uncertain about this;

I (28M) moved to a new city in January and met a guy (37M) literally the same week I arrived. We slowly started dating and have gotten pretty serious as the year has went on. Things have been great. He’s told me that his exes have all cheated on him so he has been led to expect open relationships but I’ve told him that isn’t something I’m comfortable with. Happily agreed and moved forward. 

We don’t hide when we find someone attractive nor have we chosen to keep our old sex life a secret. We’ve had our own fair share of encounters before meeting. He’s always been interested in a three way but says he’ll probably be too shy and nervous or finish too quickly. I’ve had three ways in the past before. I’ve told him they are not something I like and not something I plan on trying. 

Well last night we went out for drinks and afterwards came home and did the deed. All was fine albeit a bit drunk. We both work very early with myself working earlier. He passes out on the couch and while I normally stay over (really like 6 out of the 7 days a week) I decided that since I work extremely early I’ll head home. I try to get him to wake up so he can sleep on his bed and set his alarms but he doesn’t budge. So I grab his phone and try to ask for his passcode. He’s shown me the code and I’ve told him mine but I never remember his outside of the last few numbers. He still doesn’t budge so I guess his code and end up unlocking the phone. I set his alarms but I get this burst of anxiety (it’s been a very stressful two weeks, and I do suffer greatly from anxiety) and take a look at his messages. Nothing unusual aside from one thread. 

During the day he was texting another dude and while he tells him he’s been seeing me the conversation led to the other dude saying “I’m happy you found someone but tbh was hoping we could have some fun.” A bit paraphrased. The response was “Woof. Sounds hot and fun but we’re not open. We’ve talked about a three way though so if anything you’ll be first to know. Deal?” Which the guy replies yes. The time stamp of these texts are literally minutes prior to me driving up to his house as he waits for me outside.

I don’t know if it’s overreacting or not but I just feel very indifferent about it. There isn’t a planned secret date to fuck this guy and he pretty much said he wanted me to be a part of it. But I feel ugly that he was talking to another dude this way and not telling me about it, especially seconds before pulling up. Plus going through his phone isn’t something I’m particularly proud of.

It’s a lot and I apologize but I would just like some perspectives on how you would view all this and what to do next? I know ultimately it’s my choice on how I proceed but I’m just confused and a bit hurt. 

**TLDR; boyfriend texting a dude how hot it would be to have a three way with him should the occasion arise.**",0
1476,"Toddler's first haircut - experiences? Warning: I overthink everything about .

My 2-year-old's hair is getting scraggly and I'm thinking I want to get it trimmed within the next few months. She has curly hair, and I really want to take care of it the proper way. I'm a bit wary of kids' salons because I feel like they're less likely to know specifically how to cut curly hair. I'm also not sure it even matters that much if I'm just going to get her hair trimmed an inch or so. I'm also definitely not doing it myself because I'm the least coordinated person on the planet and it would turn out uneven.

I'm wondering about anyone's first experiences getting their toddler's hair cut if you decided to go to an adult salon (if they'll even agree to cut a toddler's hair). I'm thinking of finding a place that specializes in curly hair. If you've done this with your toddler, how did they handle the experience? Is it better to go to a kids' salon just because they have things to entertain the child, or should I go to a regular salon because they're probably more experienced in cutting hair?",1

So, we emailed all their teachers. Most of them replied saying they understand.

We felt that she’s was being very passive aggressive by saying what she said. So my question is how do we respond to this? My husband wants to call her out and say that she was very condescending by refusing to even tell us what we should be working with our son on. Are we overreacting?

972,"Help, Do you have any stories of lies backfiring? My SD4 has grown beyond wild when it comes to lying and it's getting dangerous.

Can you please give me some stories of your own or ones of history where a little lie turned out to be a big deal and backfired. I wanna drill these things into my SD's story times along with what we've been doing to help curb the lying.

Include stories or things that may be inappropriate as I'll just change details to age appropriate things.

Unnecessary Background but if you feel like reading: 
Her lying isn't a big deal when she's telling us about what a fish said to her or when it snowed (on our tropical island) but it's getting dangerous.
The worst is when SD3 threw up at breakfast and after I cleaned her up I noticed a bottle of vape (nicotine) juice in the area I'd forgotten to put away the night before (I know, my mistake). 

Putting 2 and 2 together I asked the girls if they had touched it and SD4 said she had watched SD3 drink it. My mind races through the trip to the ER to get her stomach pumped. Do I try and get her to throw more up now before we go to the ER or will they be able to get it all out in time. I'm in serious panic and we checked the house cameras to make sure SD4 is being honest, and she was lying... SD3 vomited just from eating too fast.

I'm absolutely over her lying so much and as much as I tell myself I can't hold a grudge against a 4 year old it is seriously now starting to effect how I see her and I now find my time with her frustrating and stressful.
So I'm trying to drill it into her honesty brings trust and lying is bad but 😩",1

2834,"Question on how to approach nephew with career guidance When I was a college undergrad, unfortunately, I had little guidance around career. This led to a difficult first few years of my professional life. I ended up recovering but it took a lot of hard work which, in many ways, would have been unnecessary if I had sought proper advice. 

Now that my nephew is at the same large university, I observed he’s in a similar spot – lack of advice around career. So, I offered help earlier this summer and he accepted. We spoke about career paths and what he wanted – matching his skills / interests to different employers coming to campus. We also discussed some actions he should take during this past summer to better position himself for an internship next year.

After finishing writing his resume together, I asked him to sketch out a cover letter and pointed him towards examples. I also lined up a couple calls for him through my network of contacts. However, after checking in a couple weeks later, he ignored my reach outs. Now he is back on campus and interviews begin next week. 

How should I proceed forward? (1) Ignore and just let him figure it out or (2) keep offering help?",0
1960,"I (21f) want to elope with my bf (26m)to escape my toxic and abusive household but my family would never forgive me for this. Hey everyone, this is my first time ever on reddit and I'm afraid this is going to be all over the place.

I belong to a strict religious family who use religion to their own benefit. I've grown up in a really toxic and controlling household. I love my parents but i can't help hating them as well. I mean, they're affectionate towards my brother and I, and i generally have a good relationship with them. But it can't change the fact that my upbringing and the toxic environment i've grown up in has caused a lot of damage to me. 

My dad has anger issues and he has been physically and emotionally abusive towards my mother since the beginning of their marriage. It was so bad that when my mom was pregnant with me, neither my dad nor his mother (who lived in the same house as them) took her to a doctor until the 7th month. My dad even hit her on two occasions while she was pregnant and she had no medicines and no one took care of her diet. She almost died while giving birth to me. The physical abuse has gotten less frequent over the years, and the last time it happened was 2 years ago. I tried to stop him but he hit me as well and stopped talking to me and would yell at me if i tried talking which resulted in me stressing out and skipping final exams for my 2nd semester in uni. 

The emotional and mental abuse still continues though. My mom just tolerates all his bullshit and does nothing about it. She gets really frustrated and yells a lot at me and my brother to take her anger out. She talks about all the abuse she has faced over the years with me and when I try telling her how all of this affects me badly, she just says that I'm being ungrateful for all the things my dad does for us and I shouldn't say anything bad about him. I don't fucking understand this. 

I feel suffocated and caged in my own house. It's like even our emotions are controlled by my father. We can't be happy unless he wants us to be. We can't show out unhappiness at his behaviour because that makes him angry. I'm not allowed to do anything even though I'm an adult. I can't even move out as it's not a norm here and my parents will never let me. I'm not allowed to go out at all without my parents but my dad also rarely ever takes us out. I've lost almost all my friends because I'm not allowed to hang out with them. I have to wear what they want me to wear. I'm not allowed to talk to the opposite gender outside of family and my dad didn't even let me go to a good college or university because he didn't want me studying with guys like wtf. I now study in a shitty uni which is all girls. All the good ones are co-ed.

All my life I have been stuck in this cycle of abuse and toxicity. I have no self confidence and zero self esteem. I have severe anxiety since childhood and i get panic attacks as well sometimes but my mom thinks it's no big deal so I can't get therapy. My mental health is becoming a mess day by day. I have very poor social skills and I have missed out on so many opportunities because of my anxiety and my parents. 21 years of my life have been such a waste. The only emotions I've known the most are fear, anxiety and anger. 

I just want to escape from here and now i think i have this chance. I fell in love with this amazing guy 1.5 years ago and we've been in a relationship since then. He's the exact opposite of men i've seen all my life. He works in another city so we meet like twice every month and things are going great. He loves me a lot and wants to marry me but the problem is that my parents would never allow me to marry someone of my choice. They want me to get an arranged marriage without even meeting the guy. My mom said if she ever found out that i'm involved with some guy, she'd choke me to death :) 

My bf is my only chance to escape out of this hell. I just can't waste my life away like this and then get married to another asshole because my dad's definitely gonna find me a guy with his mentality. I can't even tell my dad about him cos I'm sure he's gonna flip out and beat me up. He would never agree. My only option is to elope with my bf. However, in my culture and society, that's the worst thing you can do as it would bring huge ""dishonor"" upon the family and everyone will label such a woman as characterless. If i ever do that, it would be a huge blow to my family and they would never forgive me. 

I'm so confused about what should i do. Should I sacrifice my freedom and the love of my life for my family? Or should I stop caring about what my parents will have to face and run away to live my life on my own terms? I desperately want to get out of here and I want to be with my bf as i love him way too much. But I'm so confused. 

TLDR; I've grown up in an abusive and toxic household and all my actions are controlled by my parents. I desperately want to escape and I have an amazing bf who wants to marry me but my parents would never agree for a love marriage. My only option is to elope with him as i don't want an arranged marriage and waste my life away. However, my family or my society would never forgive me for eloping. Im really confused about what should i do.",0
1549,"Too Much Sugar and Screentime? I'm a first time mom (31) and my daughter (6) has been in kindergarten for one week. She's my only child so this is all new to me. I feel like the school gives her too much sugar.  She gets juice for breakfast and lunch and on Monday she had a cupcake for a birthday and she tells me the teacher gives her skittles every day for behaving.   I can send her with Lunch and breakfast but they still give her juice.  She already had the starts of cavities in preschool (thanks to me and grandma but we cut that shit out) and I'm worried this will cause more cavities and I'm the one who will end up paying for it, not the school.  

Also I'm concerned that so far all the class has done is play PBS kids games on their tablets (aside from music class, the gym, library). I took my daughters tablet away months ago because it's always a fight with her throwing a tantrum if I put boundaries on it, so I just took it for good.  I didn't know the school would be giving them tablets with games that they can take home and of course she is back to screaming and throwing a fit if I take the tablet (I don't allow technology after dinner). 

Is this normal for public school? When my daughter was in Montessori preschool they focused on hands-on activities that taught the children needed skills.  They also encouraged healthy snacks, no juice, no candy, and definitely no tablets unless the kids were waiting to get picked up. In that case the whole class shared one tablet.  

I should also add that I'm a bit of a helicopter mom...I worry about my kid a lot ( hell, I worry about everything! I have diagnosed mental illness). Am I being crazy here? 

TLDR: Is it normal for public school to give lots of sweets and screentime to students, or am I overthinking this? Do all you other parents not mind sweets and screentime?

Thanks for any advice!",1
2456,"BF Would Rather Buy me Things Than Learn to Talk to me I’m a 24F with BPD and my BF IS 24 with AvPD.

When I call, I’ll vent a bit and then it’ll just be silent. He won’t say anything except maybe “I love you” and “you’re beautiful”. That’s not what I want to hear. I want to have a conversation. I’ve said that but he just draws a blank and then the silence irritates me because I can be silent by myself. He will get upset with himself and say “if I had more money, I could buy this or that for you”, but that doesn’t fix the emotional aspect of my issue. I can provide for myself, I just want comfort in the moment but he seems incapable of doing that. When I commented on the silence he just started talking about his day like I wanted to be distracted, but I don’t. I want to talk though issues for i can get over them, but he just can’t do it.

Since everyone is a piece of shit obsessed with their internet fame, they struck first by publicly making up a fake narrative about me, formed a group of friends that would lie for her and back her, and then tried to cancel me. Internet is a shit ass place.)

I normally wouldn't care much about ""canceling""... But one of the group attacked my personal life. Personal life is where I draw the line.

One of the people in the group was one of my GF's friends. This friend contacted my GF and was trying to convince her to break up with me (saying things such as I was abusive, crazy, unhinged, inferred rape... and that she would call someone to check in on her safety physically... anything she could say to manipulate my GF.) This person was also internet friends with me for over a year, but never met me in person.... Her behavior was a sharp 180. I was shocked.

My GF didn't defend me, she more played neutral. She came to me and showed me the conversation (she was frustrated and shocked by what the friend was saying.) My GF said she just wanted to collect info and not cause more issues, although I knew this was a lie she told me cuz she was just not wanting to have an awkward situation where she had to defend me and shut down her friend. I asked why she would continuously let her friend talk about me in such a harsh way, and it makes our relationship look and feel like a joke by allowing it. I was hurt.

My GF realized I was right, but flustered she went back to her conversation with her friend and kinda stood up for me. After she was done, my GF came back to me and got mad at me for ""bringing drama into my (her) life and making me (her) lose a friend."" Some friend whos willing to lie to ruin your relationship all for the sake of cancel culture, right?

I realized this dynamic between me and my GF was bad for us. I tried to address the issue the next day. I said it was bad that we didnt work together during this situation, and what if something happens in the future, will we just get stressed and attack eachother again? In which her response was a shut down- ""What are you plaining on brining more drama into my life in the future? I never had drama in my life before I was with you.""

I didnt know how to take this. Already the original issue was affecting me emotionally and I needed someone to be behind me. She wasnt. It felt like being punched repeatedly in the gut by these people online, and then having my GF step on my throat while I was at it. It was more weird that initially before the friend contacted her, my GF was on my side, but the moment she had a chance to be held accountable for her support, she broke and attacked me.

I stuck around with my GF after this for over a year. But I never got over this problem. MY love for her was damaged now. I honestly could not look at her the same way after this. When I would sleep in the same bed with her, I would look at her and laugh to myself is the saddest most betrayed, most state of disbelief manner. I tried to address it multiple times, but each time she wrote it off as not being such a big deal. It never got settled for me. I began to feel I could not really rely on her (Can someone tell me if this is a fair feeling?)

I feel like a moron for having stayed with her for so long after this. I wanted to love her and correct things, but instead there was problem after problem after problem. This situation I wrote about was the beginning of where my heart shifted and gort much more defensive in the relationship. I knew right when this issue happened, I should've left her, but I stayed in misery for over a year.

**Can anyone talk me through some of this? I feel so off and empty now.**

Breakup Update:

To add to the problem. A year later, my GF met up with her friend that canceled me. The friend apologized and admitted that she was in the wrong in the past. The friend said that the leader of their group lied to her and that she was in the wrong. Not only that, but the leader of the group also betrayed her in similar manners as to me....

My GF not wanting an awkward air between them, forgave her (which is fine imo) but then decided to reestablish connections by Re-following her and re-friending her everywhere...

THIS was such a weird choice for me. (I understand following and friending seems superficial, but for her status in social media, it shows support and friendship to the artists AND everyone can see this.)

So someone who was publicly canceling me, and others knew she was canceling me, EVERYONE could see my GF was in support of this person. Making me and the relationship look like a complete joke.

Personally, I finally saw us as a joke after she did this. Forgive the girl thats fine... but don't betray me by wanting to be friends with this girl who admitted to lying and being on the wrong side. This girl basically admitted to trying to ruin the relationship over lies.

I did ask my GF why she felt the need to refollow/refriend her. She said it was so she wouldnt have to deal with awkwardness next time she sees her.

Didn't even bother to apologize to me who was the (I hate labeling myself this but) victim.

**Im so damn confused here. Im mainly here looking to talk. For some reason emotionally Im stuck on all this.**",0

What are the probability’s that a random hair got tangled in his beard, or is this a definite sign he’s cheating again?",0
627,"What are signs sleep training is working? I believe I’ve just one Sleep training our 9 month old girl. Day 2 so very early days. Was sleeping almost all the way through for a long time but then the last 3 months that’s stopped and she wakes several times, instantly cries until we come in and pet her back to sleep which can take 2 minutes or an hour. Usually climbs the cot and will stay that way until we come in. 

Using the Ferber method so keeping to 5-10 minutes at the moment. 

This evening for the first time she woke up, did a bit of moaning but not much, climbed the cot but then sat back down quickly and just quietly cried for a couple seconds every ten seconds or so. Didn’t put herself back to sleep but she atleast didn’t go into instant meltdown which is a complete first 

Is this a sign it’s working? What are some other signs?",1
315,"COVID at daycare We received an email notification from my daughter’s daycare that two people tested positive for COVID (they didn’t share if it were adults or children). The daycare followed quarantine guidelines, so two of the classrooms there are now shut down. My partner is understandably freaking out, and feels this is the last straw and wants to pull her. 

I don’t know if it is worth finding another daycare (since previous issues have been minor communications problems), and because she has just gotten used to her new classroom.

What would you guys do?? I want to protect my baby, but I want to think rationally about it.",1
686,"None of my daughter’s friends wished her on her birthday. I don’t want to throw a party. No one wished her, including her best friend. 
My daughter turned 7. She has a social bubble with 5 girls from her class. I meet their moms everyday and talk to them quite a bit. I had mentioned the birthday many times just this week. 

Now when it’s her friends birthdays, we video wish, make cards and what not. Some moms sent birthday wishes at like 5 pm. Kids did not wish at all. Not even a voice text. 

I was planning a birthday party with this group next weekend. But I really don’t feel like it. My husband says the party is so our daughter remembers it. It’s not about those kids. 

My daughter surprisingly hasn’t mentioned not hearing from her friends.  She’s at home right now for a possible exposure to a covid positive student. So I didn’t expect anything in person. I understand that kids don’t remember but moms can tell them like I remind my daughter. I am hurt for my daughter. She’s been at home and waiting to go back to school. Talk to me about it please.",1
870,"7mo can adjust to sitter, help? I need to leave the house for 5 hours twice a week. My baby has never been away from me and is mostly breastfeed with small amounts of baby food and formula daily. 

The sitter has came by twice now, baby is doing slightly better but still cries quite a lot. I can see and hear her and I don’t know if she will eventually adjust. She looks so sad it’s making me wonder if such experiences are traumatic to her developing brain. 

Would leaving my baby home with the sitter cause her psychological damage? It’s not just the crying, but also how her face goes blank and expressionless that makes me scared.",1
2513,"should i stop talking to them? in 2019, i met this guy on bumble. we “hung out” for almost 7 month, he even said he loved me but we never officially defined the relationship (not for lack of trying). he said that he doesn’t like labels. after 7 months we stopped talking bc he was moving back to his home country. once in a while i would reach out to check on him, but nothing beyond a friendly text. fast forward to almost October 2020 when he reached out to me again. we’ve been talking on and off since then, again nothing has been defined bc he’s still living in another country. occasionally he says “love you” and more romantical things but mostly just a little flirting and the occasional sexting. i’d like to think that we both care about each other and he does hint at something happening in the future (“I’ll come visit you”,”when you come here”) but nothing for sure. i have major trust issues, and my question is should i still keep talking to this person in attempt to connect in the future or dip out now?",0
1267,"School principal told classroom with Covid-positive child to all stay in class! Ready to get pissed off?

We live in an area with very high Covid vaccination rates, upwards of 70%. So you know where our minds are.

There are four elementary schools in our district. One school had a 5th grade kid go home due to Covid. So what's the obvious next step? The principal told the class that for the rest of the week, they couldn't go out for recess and had to eat their lunches and spend all their time in class. They could not skip school or will be marked absent, unless they also had a positive Covid test or showed symptoms.

Let that sink in. We know one kid had Covid. Maybe infected one or two more. But let's make sure *all the kids* get infected, right??

This happened last week. Parents talked to other parents and there was an uproar at the school. Only then was the class all let out of school.

So what's happened this week? All of the fifth &amp; fourth grade classes are stopped - no classes, no homework, no distance learning. I don't know if there were more cases in that school, though I guess so, since fourth grade is at home now too.

WTF is the reasoning for keeping kids in class as long as they are asymptomatic? I can only assume it was for funding. I'd sure like to ask that principal. Because I'd like to know if she put funding above the lives of kids.

Me and baby momma aren't really together but we're trying our best to keep it civil. Our son doesn't really understand that mommy and daddy aren't the best thing for each other but he loves when we're together. I love my little guy more than anything in this world which is why i'm coming here. He's 2 and 4 months and hasn't said a single word. It also seems like he doesn't really grasp things or understand. He lines up all his toys, books, water bottles, pretty much anything that cane make a line. He grinds his teeth regularly. But what is really worrying me is his social skills. If anyone new tries to talk to him he tenses up and starts to scream or complain. I had family from another sate visit and I had to take him to another room because he wouldn't stop crying. His mom and i have a great support system. Her parents are very involved and so are mine. But sometimes I think they're too involved? They give him whatever he wants and pamper him 24/7. I've gotten into legitimate arguments with my mom because she wants to give him cookies and gatorade when it's way past his bedtime just because she doesn't want to hear him cry. His mom also went through a rough patch with a mental illness and would stay in her room all day smoking a weed pen while her mom took care of the baby. I've tried to talk to my mom and bring these things up (giving him whatever he wants and constantly talking to him like a baby) she tells me to stop blaming everyone but myself. I may not be the best dad but I do try as much as I can.",1
